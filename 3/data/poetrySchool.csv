A knowledge is equal to things, and self-care is superficial. I am suddenly complacent about you, and I am not bothered by floating thoughts."

山水田园,王维,西施咏,唐,艳色天下重，西施宁久微。朝仍越溪女，暮作吴宫妃。贱日岂殊众，贵来方悟稀。邀人傅香粉，不自著罗衣。君宠益娇态，君怜无是非。当时浣纱伴，莫得同车归。持谢邻家子，效颦安可希。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,Xi Shiyong,"The world is full of gorgeous colors, but Xi Shining is long-lasting.

Without saving the sound and appearance, it is worthy of life and death. When flowers are spent, golden valleys drink, and moonlit nights sleep in bamboo forests. Dufu is spread all over the place, leaning towards the medicine ship. Qungong belongs to the eyes, and small things dare to stand shoulder-to-shoulder. Misunderstood the purpose of the contract and connected Yushu. Hang the sword first if you don't expect it, and whip when you are afraid. For the sake of goodness, I am innocent, and my confidant is absolutely perfect. Even if the sound of the piano does not disappear, it will eventually continue to be sad."

The mountains and rivers are poor, and the world is three thousand. When talking about the Buddhist universe, the king's city is dim. Trees only emerge in Baling, and the Wei River is about to reach the sky. Distant counties are divided into various kingdoms, and white smoke rises from isolated villages.

Amiable emperor state, the palaces and temples are so fanciful. Lin Duan came out of Qidao, and the top of the hall waved the banner. Suhuai is in Qingshan, if it is worth Baiyuntun. Go back to Fengcheng and Xiyu, go back to Jingyuan Shangcun. Before drinking Yingzun wine, you often hear the words clearly. The oriole sings in the deep wood, and the hibiscus shines in the middle garden. I still envy the guests under the pine, and the ape is heard clearly on the stone."

Shoot the white-fronted tiger in Zhongshan, and kill the yellow beard in Ye. He fought for three thousand miles with one body, and once became a million-dollar master with one sword. The Han soldiers were as fast as a thunderbolt, and the captives galloped and feared the thorns. Wei Qing's invincibility is due to luck, and Li Guang's undefeated luck is odd. Since it was abandoned, it has decayed, and the world has been wasted. In the past, flying arrows had no complete eyesight, but today the hanging poplar gives birth to the left elbow. When the roadside sells old Hou melons, in front of the door learns from Mr. Liu. The vast ancient trees connect the poor alleys, and the few cold mountains face the void. Oath to order Shule to come out of Feiquan is not like Yingchuan's empty wine. The battle formation at the foot of Helan Mountain is like clouds, and the feathers are crossed and heard day and night. The festival envoy Sanhe recruited young people, and the edict issued five generals. Try to brush the iron clothes like snow, and talk about moving stars with a sword. I wish to get the bow of the swallow to shoot the general of heaven, and the shame of ordering the Yue Jia to call the Wu army. Don't dislike being guarded in the clouds in the old days, it is still worthy of meritorious service in a battle."

The purple horse comes from Qingli, and the low light hangs down. I don't know where it is, so I look at Huaxuan after opening Zhuhu. Yi Sizi waited for the door, suddenly thinking about the south of the city. The heart is confused and heavy, and I look up to the inhumanity of the sky. The only one in the family, only one son. If He Yin's descendants are not numerous, they will be fresh and dead. Who will leave innocence? Ask poetry and rituals. Sorrow is invincible, how can I expect the rest of the year to recover. The sun is dark and the birds are flying. If you are poor, you will not return, and if you doubt that there will be a day, you will return.

Huzuo River Shangzhou, when from Xunyang. Traveling against Sanxiang, the long distance should be Baishe. The incense burner comes out from the far peak, and the Shijingcheng Lake lags behind. Dong Feng's apricots become forests, and Tao Qian's chrysanthemums are full. Fan Li is very fond of it, and I love Lushan Mountain. To send Junsi far away, I want to sprinkle it with a few lines."

Dong Qi'er, Su Sui weaves and Susi. It is difficult for tourists and customers to trust, and it is only when the grains are ripe. Get off the bus and close the king's thoughts, and the emperor's palace is like clothes. The high officials still eat Chen Yucup, and the red court is scattered with hanging ribbons. The imperial edict on yellow paper came out of the East Chamber, and the light and colorful piles were rotten and bright. The sons of the clan are the most virtuous, and they should be the first to share their worries. The commoner is dead with a word, not to mention the grace of the Holy Lord. The sound of Luan screamed at the Luhou Banner, and it will be planned to go to the capital next year. I must remember today's fight for wine, be careful not to be rich and forget yourself."

The emperor Gu Hebei issued an edict to eliminate the conquest of the east. He bowed his hand and resigned from the Shangguan, and walked out of Nangong slowly. Outside the Jiuhe Plain, in the Jimen Gate of the Seven Kingdoms. The wind is sad and dry, and Guseduo is flying. There are no captives in thousands of miles, and the land is empty.

When he is done, he will return as a Marquis, and he is willing to visit Shang Shanweng."

He understands Dai Jiali deeply, and learns Mao Gong's poems quite a bit. Be aware of the economic road, when the high lying pottery was in the Tang Dynasty. The Holy Lord ordered the world, and the sages shall not be left behind. The public officials are in charge of the group, and they set up a car to go to Maoci. King Canglong Que, nine gates and twelve Kui. All the princes pay homage to the court, and the crown and sword go down to Danchi. The wild crane finally staggered, and the majesty and phoenix were uneven. Or ask about the art of reasoning, but return the mountain words. The book of heaven descended to the North Que, and the silk was given to the East. Thank you for your relatives in the capital, and the journey is slow. Gufan thousands of miles away, what will Miaoman do? Jiangtian Hailing County, Yunri Huainan Temple. On Cangzhou in the dark, no one knows about the wandering. Wei Xiao or selling medicine, the source is An Neng Qi."

In the fog, the distant trees and knife states come out, and the Chengjiang River in the sky returns. The envoy is more than thirty years old, a young man with white skin and living in the city.

There is no resentment in the destiny, and there is a plain style in life. When Nian Jun brushes his clothes away, the world will be safe and poor. In autumn, thousands of miles are clean, and Chengjiang is empty at dusk. How leisurely in the clear night, in the bright moon. And the light fish and birds, Daner Jianjia Cong. There is no mediocre person to show the world, and the sun is like a canopy on the temples. Stubborn and dark personnel, secluded and remote. Small things can be picked, whoever is the best. Yu also left from then on and returned to farming as an old farmer."
山水田园,王维,送綦毋潜落第还乡,唐,圣代无隐者，英灵尽来归。遂令东山客，不得顾采薇。既至君门远，孰云吾道非。江淮度寒食，京洛缝春衣。置酒临长道，同心与我违。行当浮桂棹，未几拂荆扉。远树带行客，孤村当落晖。吾谋适不用，勿谓知音稀。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,Send Qi Wuqian back home,"There are no hermits in the holy age, and all the heroic spirits come and return. Then he ordered Dongshan guest not to Gu Caiwei. Now that you are far away from the king's gate, whoever says I am wrong. Jianghuai spends cold food, Jingluo sews spring clothes. Buying wine and facing the long road, the same heart is against me. When the line is floating osmanthus, soon the Jingfei will be blown. The distant trees lead travelers, and the isolated village should be in the sunset. My plan is suitable for use, so don't say that bosom friends are rare."
山水田园,王维,送魏郡李太守赴任,唐,与君伯氏别，又欲与君离。君行无几日，当复隔山陂。苍茫秦川尽，日落桃林塞。独树临关门，黄河向天外。前经洛阳陌，宛洛故人稀。故人离别尽，淇上转骖騑。企予悲送远，惆怅睢阳路。古木官渡平，秋城邺宫故。想君行县日，其出从如云。遥思魏公子，复忆李将军。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,Send Weijun Li Taishou to his post,"Farewell to Junbo, and want to leave Jun. After a few days of your journey, you will be separated from the mountain. The boundless Qinchuan is exhausted, and the peach forest is filled with sunset. The lone tree is about to close, and the Yellow River is facing the sky. Passing through Luoyang Mo in the past, there are few old people in Wanluo. When the old man parted, Qi went up and turned his head. Enterprises are sad to see them far away, and they are melancholy on Suiyang Road. The ancient wood Guanduping is the old palace of Yegong in Qiucheng. Thinking of the day when you travel to the county, it will come out like a cloud. Thinking of Mr. Wei from afar, recalling General Li."

Nian Jun waits for death, everything hurts human feelings. The loving mother was not buried in time, and the daughter was only ten years old. In the frigid suburbs, Depression hears crying. Floating clouds are boundless, and birds cannot sing. How lonely pedestrians are, the day is desolate. When Yixi Jun was around, he asked me that I had learned nothing. Advise you to suffer before it is too early, so that you can't achieve anything. The old people have their own gifts, but they are not as good as their lives. Negative Erfei all the way, weeping and returning to Chaijing."
山水田园,王维,座上走笔赠薛璩慕容损,唐,希世无高节，绝迹有卑栖。君徒视人文，吾固和天倪。缅然万物始，及与群物齐。分地依后稷，用天信重黎。春风何豫人，令我思东溪。草色有佳意，花枝稍含荑。更待风景好，与君藉萋萋。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,"On the seat, the pen is presented to Xue Chu and Murong Sui","There are no high festivals in the rare world, but there are humble habitats in the extinct. Juntu regards humanities, Wugu and Tianni. All things start, and all things are equal. Divide the land according to Houji, and use the trust of heaven to emphasize Li. The spring breeze from Heyu makes me think of Dongxi. The color of the grass is good, and the flowers and branches contain a little catkin. Let's wait for the scenery to be better, and borrow luxuriantly with you."
山水田园,王维,桃源行,唐,渔舟逐水爱山春，两岸桃花夹去津。坐看红树不知远，行尽青溪不见人。山口潜行始隈隩，山开旷望旋平陆。遥看一处攒云树，近入千家散花竹。樵客初传汉姓名，居人未改秦衣服。居人共住武陵源，还从物外起田园。月明松下房栊静，日出云中鸡犬喧。惊闻俗客争来集，竞引还家问都邑。平明闾巷埽花开，薄暮渔樵乘水入。初因避地去人间，及至成仙遂不还。峡里谁知有人事，世中遥望空云山。不疑灵境难闻见，尘心未尽思乡县。出洞无论隔山水，辞家终拟长游衍。自谓经过旧不迷，安知峰壑今来变。当时只记入山深，青溪几曲到云林。春来遍是桃花水，不辨仙源何处寻。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,Taoyuan line,"Fishing boats chase water and love mountains and spring, peach blossoms on both sides go to Tianjin. Sitting and looking at the mangroves, I don't know how far away, and I can't see people when I go to the Qingxi. Sneaking through the mountain pass begins, and the mountain opens up to look at the flat land. Looking at a cloud-accumulating tree from a distance, and entering thousands of bamboos scattered flowers. The woodcutter first passed on the name of the Han Dynasty, but the residence did not change the clothes of the Qin Dynasty. Residents live in Wulingyuan together, and they also start from the countryside outside the things. The room under the moon is quiet under the pines, and the chickens and dogs in the clouds are noisy at sunrise. I was shocked to hear that vulgar visitors came to gather here, and they competed to attract home and ask about the city. In Pingming Lu Lane, the flowers bloom, and at dusk, fishermen and woodcutters enter by water. At the beginning, he went to the human world because he avoided the land, but he didn't return it when he became a fairy. Who knows that there are people in the gorge, and the world looks at the Kongyun Mountain. It is not doubted that the spiritual realm is hard to smell and see, and the heart of dust is not exhausted and homesick for the county. Regardless of the mountains and rivers when you leave the cave, the Ci family will eventually plan to travel for a long time. It is said that the past is not obsessed with the past, but Anzhi's peaks and valleys have changed in the present. At that time, it was only recorded as deep in the mountains, and the Qingxi River went to Yunlin a few times. When spring comes, there is peach blossom water everywhere, and I don't know where to find the fairy source."
山水田园,王维,留别山中温古上人兄并示舍弟缙,唐,解薜登天朝，去师偶时哲。岂惟山中人，兼负松上月。宿昔同游止，致身云霞末。开轩临颍阳，卧视飞鸟没。好依盘石饭，屡对瀑泉渴。理齐小狎隐，道胜宁外物。舍弟官崇高，宗兄此削发。荆扉但洒扫，乘闲当过歇。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,Leaving farewell to the elder brother Wen Gu in the mountains and showing his younger brother Jin,"Xie Xue ascended to the heavenly dynasty, and went to learn from my even Shizhe. How can you be a person in the mountains, who also bears the pine and the moon. In the past, we traveled with each other until the end of the clouds. Kaixuan is facing Yingyang, lying down and watching the birds disappear. I like to rely on Panshifan, and I am often thirsty for waterfalls and springs. Li Qi Xiao Xing Yin, Dao Sheng Ning foreign things. The brother-in-law is lofty, and the elder brother shaved his hair. The Jingfei is sweeping and sweeping, taking the time to rest."
山水田园,王维,资圣寺送甘二,唐,浮生信如寄，薄宦夫何有。来往本无归，别离方此受。柳色蔼春馀，槐阴清夏首。不觉御沟上，衔悲执杯酒。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,Sending off Gan Er from Zisheng Temple,"A letter from a floating life is like sending a message, so why is there a poor eunuch?

Sometimes the farming is idle, and the neighbors are called to drink wine. Noisy under the eaves, or sit or rise again. The short brown is not thin, and the garden sunflower is solid and beautiful. If you move, you will have children and grandchildren, and you will never go to the city. The five emperors and the three kings were called the sons of heaven in ancient times. Fighting will give way, after all, who is right. If you are proud, you will be happy, but Noda Yasuzu is contemptible. And when you let go, there are no teeth left."

Ask you why, I am the baby of the world net. The little sister grows up day by day, but the brother is not married. The family is poor and the salary is thin, and the savings are not good. I wanted to fly several times, but hesitated and looked at each other again. Sun Deng Changxiaotai, Songzhu has left a place. It's a little far away, but the old man is in the middle. The day of love dyeing has faded, and the day of Zen silence has solidified. Suddenly I will go, I would rather wait until the age of the cloud."
山水田园,王维,偶然作六首 其四,唐,陶潜任天真，其性颇耽酒。自从弃官来，家贫不能有。九月九日时，菊花空满手。中心窃自思，傥有人送否。白衣携壶觞，果来遗老叟。且喜得斟酌，安问升与斗。奋衣野田中，今日嗟无负。兀傲迷东西，蓑笠不能守。倾倒强行行，酣歌归五柳。生事不曾问，肯愧家中妇。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,Occasionally compose four out of six poems,"Tao Qian is naive, and his nature is quite drunk.

At six o'clock, I beat the chime, and I often take a rope when I drink. Farming and burning white clouds, chopping paint ringing Danhe. Walk with the chestnut ape and return to the nest with the pine crane. At that time, the mountain god invited me, and I came across the Cave Immortal Expo by chance. The salvation of the world is more merciful, that is, the heart does not act. Zhou and Shang were tired of accumulating obstacles, and many things in Shu were flooded. The belly of the rock pierces sideways at first glance, and the lip of the stream stretches out from time to time. The bridge is due to the fallen tree frame, and the gate is bound by weeping vines. The bird path has been leveled, and the Dragon Palace has dried up. Whoever jumps over the waves will not be touched by the cliff. The mountains and trees are cloudy day by day, and they return to the old forest in knots. Always in Shimen, Ren Jun's spring grass is deep."

Wei Huo is worthy of a cavalry general, and the imperial court does not count second masters. Zhao Weiyan, Han Duojin died, and Guanxi Xia Shao He Baobo. Reporting is just smelling and tasting guts, and drinking has never hurt to scrape the bones. Painting halberds, carvings and carvings, the sun is cold, and even the flags are full of yellow dust. Folding drums turn the vast sea waves far away, Ming Jia disturbs the sky, mountains and moon. The kylin brocade wears the Wu hook, and the green lilies leap over the purple lilies. With the sword drawn, Tianjiao's arm has been broken, and the head of the moon is returned to the saddle to drink together. The Han soldiers shouted that one is worth a hundred, and the captive cavalry looked at each other crying and worrying. Although the teaching war is ordered to go to the fire, it is finally known that the general will attack first."

Don't have to live in one place, don't be empty-hearted. Ning asked spring and summer, who talks about west and east. I don't know me and my son, if one is a foolish old man. In my family's Foolish Valley, this valley was originally flat. Although there is no trace, it can still respond to the sound. Don't follow the clouds to get dark, just wait for the sun to shine. Yuandi is called the Valley of Foolishness, and it is all formed by foolishness. I would like to ask Yugong Valley and chat with you. If you don't look for it, you will turn to the valley, and this valley will not be centrifugal. There was no danger in the line, how deep is it when you look at it. Send a message to the guests of the world, where do you want to return."
山水田园,王维,恭懿太子挽歌五首,唐,何悟藏环早，才知拜璧年。翀天王子去，对日圣君怜。树转宫犹出，笳悲马不前。虽蒙绝驰道，京兆别开阡。兰殿新恩切，椒宫夕临幽。白云随凤管，明月在龙楼。人向青山哭，天临渭水愁。鸡鸣常问膳，今恨玉京留。骑吹凌霜发，旌旗夹路陈。凯容金节护，册命玉符新。傅母悲香褓，君家拥画轮。射熊今梦帝，秤象问何人。苍舒留帝宠，子晋有仙才。五岁过人智，三天使鹤催。心悲阳禄馆，目断望思台。若道长安近，何为更不来。西望昆池阔，东瞻下杜平。山朝豫章馆，树转凤凰城。五校连旗色，千门叠鼓声。金环如有验，还向画堂生。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,Prince Gongyi's Five Elegies,"He Wu Zanghuan early, only to know the year of worship. The prince of Chongtian went to show pity to the sun sage. The tree turned and the palace still came out, but the sad horse didn't move forward. Although Meng Jue Chi Road, Jingzhao don't open the fields. Lan Dian Xin Enqie, Jiao Gong Xi Linyou. The white clouds follow the phoenix, and the bright moon is in the dragon tower. People cry to the green mountains, and the sky is sad when it faces the Weishui. The cock crows often asks about food, but now I hate Yujingliu. Riding and blowing Lingshuang's hair, flags and flags spread across the road. Kairong protects the golden festival, and the jade talisman is new. Fu's mother mourns the fragrant baby, and Jun's family holds a painting wheel. Shoot the Xiong Jinmeng Emperor, and the scale elephant asks who it is. Cang Shuliu is favored by the emperor, and Zijin has immortal talent. Five-year-old is superhumanly intelligent, and three-year-old crane reminds him. My heart is sad for Yanglu Pavilion, and my eyes are broken and I look at Sitai. If Dao Changan is near, why not come. Look west at Kunchi, and look east at Duping. Shanchao Yuzhang Pavilion, the tree turns to Phoenix City. The colors of the flags of the five schools, and the sound of drums stacked by thousands of gates. If Jinhuan has experience, he will return to Huatang."
山水田园,王维,故太子太师徐公挽歌四首,唐,功德冠群英，弥纶有大名。轩皇用风后，傅说是星精。就第优遗老，来朝诏不名。留侯常辟谷，何苦不长生。谋猷为相国，翊戴奉宸舆。剑履升前殿，貂蝉托后车。齐侯疏土宇，汉室赖图书。僻处留田宅，仍才十顷馀。旧里趋庭日，新年置酒辰。闻诗鸾渚客，献赋凤楼人。北首辞明主，东堂哭大臣。犹思御朱辂，不惜污车茵。久践中台座，终登上将坛。谁言断车骑，空忆盛衣冠。风日咸阳惨，笳箫渭水寒。无人当便阙，应罢太师官。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,Four Elegies of the Former Prince and Grand Master Xu Gong,"Merit crowns all heroes, and Mi Lun has a great name. After Emperor Xuan used the wind, Fu said it was a star essence. As for Diyou's old man, he came to the imperial edict without a name. The Marquis of Liu is often bigu, so why not live forever. Mouyou is the prime minister, Yi Dai Fengchenyu. The sword ascends to the front hall, and the Diao Chan supports the rear chariot. Qihou Shutuyu, Han Dynasty Lai Shu. There are still only ten hectares of fields and houses left in secluded places. The old house is approaching the court day, and the new year is full of wine. Hearing poems from Luanzhu, offering Fu to Fenglou people. The north head resigned from the Ming Lord, and the east hall cried for the minister. I still think about imperial Zhu Ren, and I don't hesitate to pollute the car. After practicing the middle seat for a long time, he finally boarded the altar of generals. Whoever says that the car rides, the air recalls the clothes. The windy day is miserable in Xianyang, and the water in Wei and Xiao is cold. If no one is ready, the grand master should be dismissed."
山水田园,王维,故西河郡杜太守挽歌三首,唐,天上去西征，云中护北平。生擒白马将，连破黑雕城。忽见刍灵苦，徒闻竹使荣。空留左氏传，谁继卜商名。返葬金符守，同归石窌妻。卷衣悲画翟，持翣待鸣鸡。容卫都人惨，山川驷马嘶。犹闻陇上客，相对哭征西。涂刍去国门，秘器出东园。太守留金印，夫人罢锦轩。旌旗转衰木，箫鼓上寒原。坟树应西靡，长思魏阙恩。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,Three Elegies of the Former Prefect Du of Xihe County,"Go to the west in the sky, protect Beiping in the clouds. Capture the white horse general alive, and break through the Black Eagle City. Suddenly see the bitterness of the cud, but only hear the glory of the bamboo. Leave Zuo's biography empty, who will follow the divination business name. The golden talisman was buried back, and Shi Yu's wife was also returned. Rolling clothes sadly painted Zhai, waiting for the crowing cock. The people in Weidu are miserable, and the mountains and rivers are neighing. I still heard that Longshang Ke was crying to conquer the West. Tu Chu went to the gate of the country, and the secret weapon came out of the East Garden. The eunuch left the golden seal, and the wife dismissed Jinxuan. Banners turn to decaying wood, flutes and drums go to Hanyuan. The grave tree should be in the west, long thinking about Wei Que'en."
山水田园,王维,班婕妤三首,唐,玉窗萤影度，金殿人声绝。秋夜守罗帷，孤灯耿不灭。宫殿生秋草，君王恩幸疏。那堪闻凤吹，门外度金舆。怪来妆阁闭，朝下不相迎。总向春园里，花间笑语声。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,Three Poems by Ban Jieyu,"The jade window is full of fireflies, and the Golden Palace is full of voices. Autumn night guarding the curtains, the lonely lamp never goes out. Autumn grass grows in the palace, and the king's favor is sparse. That can hear the phoenix blowing, and the golden jade is outside the door. It's strange that the make-up pavilion is closed, and the face down does not welcome each other. Always in the spring garden, there is laughter among the flowers."
山水田园,王维,阙题二首,唐,荆溪白石出，天寒红叶稀。山路元无雨，空翠湿人衣。相看不忍发，惨淡暮潮平。语罢更携手，月明洲渚生。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,Que title two,"White stones come out of Jingxi, and the red leaves are thin in the cold weather. There is no rain on the mountain road, and people's clothes are wet in the empty emerald green. I can't bear to look at each other, and the evening tide is bleak. After speaking, let's join hands, Yuemingzhou Zhusheng."
山水田园,王维,杂曲歌辞 少年行四首,唐,新丰美酒斗十千，咸阳游侠多少年。相逢意气为君饮，系马高楼垂柳边。出身仕汉羽林郎，初随骠骑战渔阳。孰知不向边庭苦，纵死犹闻侠骨香。一身能擘两雕弧，虏骑千重只似无。偏坐金鞍调白羽，纷纷射杀五单于。汉家君臣欢宴终，高议云台论战功。天子临轩赐侯印，将军佩出明光宫。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,Four Poems of Miscellaneous Songs and Lyrics,"How many years have you been a ranger in Xianyang for ten thousand Xinfeng fine wines? When you meet, you will drink for the king, and you will be tied to a horse, a tall building, and a weeping willow. Born as an official Han Habayashiro, he first followed the hussars to fight Yuyang. Who knows that if you don't suffer from the side court, you will still hear the fragrance of chivalrous bones even if you die. A body can break two carved arcs, and a captive riding a thousand weights seems to be nothing. Sitting on the golden saddle and tuning Bai Yu, they shot and killed Wu Danyu one after another. At the end of the banquet, the monarchs and ministers of the Han family talked about Yuntai's military exploits. The emperor Linxuan bestowed Hou Yin, and the general wore it out of Mingguang Palace."
山水田园,王维,戏赠张五弟諲三首 其二,唐,张弟五车书，读书仍隐居。染翰过草圣，赋诗轻子虚。闭门二室下，隐居十年馀。宛是野人野，时从渔父渔。秋风自萧索，五柳高且疏。望此去人世，渡水向吾庐。岁晏同携手，只应君与予。设罝守毚兔，垂钓伺游鳞。此是安口腹，非关慕隐沦。吾生好清净，蔬食去情尘。今子方豪荡，思为鼎食人。我家南山下，动息自遗身。入鸟不相乱，见兽皆相亲。云霞成伴侣，虚白侍衣巾。何事须夫子，邀予谷口真。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,Two of the three poems presented to Zhang Wudi,"Brother Zhang has five carts of books, and he still lives in seclusion while studying. Dyeing Han is the saint of grass, and writing poems is light on son's emptiness. Closed the door and lived in seclusion for more than ten years. Wan is a savage, when he fishes from a fisherman. The autumn wind is bleak, and the five willows are tall and sparse. Looking forward to going to the world, crossing the water to my house. Year-old Yan Tong join hands, only the king should give. Set up a scorpion to guard the rabbit, and a fisherman to wait for the scales. This is about eating and drinking, not about Mu Yin. My life is so clean, and I eat vegetables to get rid of the dust of love. Today, Zifang is a hero, thinking of eating people on a tripod. At the foot of the Nanshan Mountain in my house, I move and breathe from my body. Birds don't mess with each other, and beasts meet each other. Yunxia becomes a partner, and the empty white attendant wears a towel. If you need a master, please invite Makoto Taniguchi."
山水田园,王维,与胡居士皆病寄此诗兼示学人二首,唐,一兴微尘念，横有朝露身。如是睹阴界，何方置我人。碍有固为主，趣空宁舍宾。洗心讵悬解，悟道正迷津。因爱果生病，从贪始觉贫。色声非彼妄，浮幻即吾真。四达竟何遣，万殊安可尘。胡生但高枕，寂寞与谁邻。战胜不谋食，理齐甘负薪。予若未始异，讵论疏与亲。浮空徒漫漫，汎有定悠悠。无乘及乘者，所谓智人舟。讵舍贫病域，不疲生死流。无烦君喻马，任以我为牛。植福祠迦叶，求仁笑孔丘。何津不鼓棹，何路不摧辀。念此闻思者，胡为多阻修。空虚花聚散，烦恼树稀稠。灭相成无记，生心坐有求。降吴复归蜀，不到莫相尤。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,I am both sick with Jushi Hu and sent this poem and two poems to show scholars,"With a whim of a dusty thought, there will be a morning exposure. If you see the world of the underworld, where will you put me? Obstacles are based on solidity, and fun is empty rather than Shebin. Cleanse the mind and solve the problem, and realize the Tao is in the maze. Falling ill because of love, from being greedy to feeling poor. The color and sound are not delusional, and the illusion is my truth. Why did Si Da send, Wan Shu'an Kechen. Hu Sheng but sit back and relax, who is lonely next to him. If you win without food, you will be willing to pay your salary. If I have not changed at the beginning, I will talk about sparseness and relatives. The floating sky is long, and there is a sense of steadiness. There is no vehicle and the person who rides, the so-called wise man's boat. Living in the poor and diseased areas, never tired of life and death. Don't worry about the horse, let me be a cow. Zhifu shrine to Kasyapa, begging for benevolence and laughing at Confucius. He Jin does not drum, and He Lu does not destroy. Those who read this, hear and think, Hu is a lot of resistance to repair. The flowers gather and disperse in emptiness, and the trees of troubles are sparse and dense. There is nothing to remember when the phase is destroyed, and there is nothing to be desired. Descending Wu and returning to Shu, Mo Xiangyou did not arrive."
山水田园,王维,晦日游大理韦卿城南别业四声依次用各六韵,唐,与世澹无事，自然江海人。侧闻尘外游，解骖?朱轮。平野照暄景，上天垂春云。张组竟北阜，汎舟过东邻。故乡信高会，牢醴及佳辰。幸同击壤乐，心荷尧为君。郊居杜陵下，永日同携手。仁里霭川阳，平原见峰首。园庐鸣春鸠，林薄媚新柳。上卿始登席，故老前为寿。临当游南陂，约略执杯酒。归欤绌微官，惆怅心自咎。冬中馀雪在，墟上春流驶。风日畅怀抱，山川多秀气。彫胡先晨炊，庖脍亦云至。高情浪海岳，浮生寄天地。君子外簪缨，埃尘良不啻。所乐衡门中，陶然忘其贵。高馆临澄陂，旷然荡心目。淡荡动云天，玲珑映墟曲。鹊巢结空林，雉雊响幽谷。应接无闲暇，徘徊以踯躅。纡组上春堤，侧弁倚乔木。弦望忽已晦，后期洲应绿。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,Traveling on a dark day in Dali Wei Qing Chengnan Bieye four tones in turn with six rhymes,"Nothing to do with the world, naturally Jianghai people. Side smell dust travel, solution? Zhu Lun. Hirano shines on Xuanjing, and spring clouds hang from the sky. Zhang Zu went to Beifu and went boating past the east neighbor. Xingaohui in my hometown, prison and good time. Fortunate to hit the soil with music, heart lotus Yao is the king. Living under Du Ling in the suburbs, we will join hands with each other forever. In Renli Ai Chuanyang, the plain sees the peak. The spring doves are singing in the garden, and the new willows are charming in the forest. Shangqing began to attend the banquet, so old age is longevity. When you are going to visit Nanpi, you will hold a glass of wine. Returning to the humble official, I feel sad and blame myself. In the middle of winter, there is still snow, and the spring flow is driving on the market. The wind is smooth and the sun is embraced, and the mountains and rivers are so delicate. Carved Hu first cooks in the morning, and it is also cloudy to cook. High love wave Haiyue, floating life sent to heaven and earth. A gentleman's hairpin tassels are as good as dust. In Suo Leheng's gate, Tao Ran forgot its value. The Gaoguan is adjacent to Chengpi, which is open and mind-blowing. The sky is light and the sky is moving, and the music is exquisitely reflected in the market. Magpie nests form empty forests, and pheasants ring in valleys. There is no leisure to meet, wandering and wandering. On the spring embankment of the Yu group, the side bench leans against the arbor. The string looks suddenly dark, and the island should be green in the later period."
山水田园,王维,鱼山神女祠歌 其二 送神,唐,纷进舞兮堂前，目眷眷兮琼筵。来不言兮意不传，作暮雨兮愁空山。悲急管兮思繁弦，神之驾兮俨欲旋。倏云收兮雨歇，山青青兮水潺湲。坎坎击鼓，鱼山之下。吹洞箫，望极浦。女巫进，纷屡舞。陈瑶席，湛清酤，风凄凄兮夜雨。不知神之来兮不来，使我心兮苦复苦。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,Temple Song of the Goddess of Yushan Part Two,"They entered the dance hall one after another, and their eyes were on Qiongyan. When you come, you don't say anything, but you don't convey your meaning, and you worry about the empty mountains when it rains in the evening. Sorrowful and urgent, thinking about complicated strings, driving God like wanting to spin. The clouds are gathering and the rain is resting, and the mountains are green and the water is gurgling. Kankan drums, under the mountain of fish. Blow the flute and watch Jipu. The witch came in and danced again and again. Chen Yao seats, Zhanqing wine, the wind is desolate and rainy at night. I don't know whether God will come or not, which makes my heart suffer again and again."
山水田园,王维,偶然作六首,唐,楚国有狂夫，茫然无心想。散发不冠带，行歌南陌上。孔丘与之言，仁义莫能奖。未尝肯问天，何事须击壤。复笑采薇人，胡为乃长往。田舍有老翁，垂白衡门里。有时农事闲，斗酒呼邻里。喧聒茅檐下，或坐或复起。短褐不为薄，园葵固足美。动则长子孙，不曾向城市。五帝与三王，古来称天子。干戈将揖让，毕竟何者是。得意苟为乐，野田安足鄙。且当放怀去，行行没馀齿。日夕见太行，沈吟未能去。问君何以然，世网婴我故。小妹日成长，兄弟未有娶。家贫禄既薄，储蓄非有素。几回欲奋飞，踟蹰复相顾。孙登长啸台，松竹有遗处。相去讵几许，故人在中路。爱染日已薄，禅寂日已固。忽乎吾将行，宁俟岁云暮。陶潜任天真，其性颇耽酒。自从弃官来，家贫不能有。九月九日时，菊花空满手。中心窃自思，傥有人送否。白衣携壶觞，果来遗老叟。且喜得斟酌，安问升与斗。奋衣野田中，今日嗟无负。兀傲迷东西，蓑笠不能守。倾倒强行行，酣歌归五柳。生事不曾问，肯愧家中妇。赵女弹箜篌，复能邯郸舞。夫婿轻薄儿，斗鸡事齐主。黄金买歌笑，用钱不复数。许史相经过，高门盈四牡。客舍有儒生，昂藏出邹鲁。读书三十年，腰间无尺组。被服圣人教，一生自穷苦。老来懒赋诗，惟有老相随。宿世谬词客，前身应画师。不能舍馀习，偶被世人知。名字本皆是，此心还不知。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,by chance six poems,"There is a madman in Chu State, who is at a loss and has no intention of thinking. Scattered without a crown, singing on Nanmo. Confucius and Zhizhi said that benevolence and righteousness cannot be rewarded. I'm not willing to ask the sky, why should I hit the soil. Hu Wei Nai longs for the people who laugh at the pickers again. There is an old man in the farmhouse, who hangs in the gate of Baiheng. Sometimes the farming is idle, and the neighbors are called to drink wine. Noisy under the eaves, or sit or rise again. The short brown is not thin, and the garden sunflower is solid and beautiful. If you move, you will have children and grandchildren, and you will never go to the city. The five emperors and the three kings were called the sons of heaven in ancient times. Fighting will give way, after all, who is right. If you are proud, you will be happy, but Noda Yasuzu is contemptible. And when you let go, there are no teeth left. Seeing Taihang day and night, Shen Yin failed to go. Ask you why, I am the baby of the world net. The little sister grows up day by day, but the brother is not married. The family is poor and the salary is thin, and the savings are not good. I wanted to fly several times, but hesitated and looked at each other again. Sun Deng Changxiaotai, Songzhu has left a place. It's a little far away, but the old man is in the middle. The day of love dyeing has faded, and the day of Zen silence has solidified. Suddenly I will go, I would rather wait until the age of the cloud. Tao Qian is naive, and his nature is quite drunk. Since I abandoned my official position, I can't have a poor family. On September 9th, the chrysanthemums were empty. The center is secretly thinking, whether someone will send it off. White clothes carry a pot of wine, and the fruit comes to leave behind the old man. And happy to think about it, An asked about promotion and fighting. Fenyi Ye Tianzhong, today is nothing to lose. If you are obsessed with things arrogantly, you can't keep the coir hat. Dump and force it, and sing to the five willows. If you don't ask about things, you will be ashamed of your housewife. Zhao Nv played the harp and was able to dance in Handan again. The husband and son-in-law are frivolous, and the cockfight is the master. Gold buys songs and laughs, and money is innumerable. Xu Shixiang passed by, and the Gaomen was full of four mus. There are Confucian scholars in the guest house, and Zou Lu is hidden in Angzang. After studying for thirty years, I don't have a ruler around my waist. Being taught by a sage, he has been poor all his life. I am lazy to write poems when I am old, but I am only old. A former poet, formerly a painter. I can't give up the rest of my studies, and I will be known to the world. The name is all there, but the heart still doesn't know."
山水田园,王维,送友人归山歌二首,唐,山寂寂兮无人，又苍苍兮多木。群龙兮满朝，君何为兮空谷。文寡和兮思深，道难知兮行独。悦石上兮流泉，与松间兮草屋。入云中兮养鸡，上山头兮抱犊。神与枣兮如瓜，虎卖杏兮收谷。愧不才兮妨贤，嫌既老兮贪禄。誓解印兮相从，何詹尹兮何卜。山中人兮欲归，云冥冥兮雨霏霏，水惊波兮翠菅靡。白鹭忽兮翻飞，君不可兮褰衣。山万重兮一云，混天地兮不分。树晻暧兮氛氲，猿不见兮空闻。忽山西兮夕阳，见东皋兮远村。平芜绿兮千里，眇惆怅兮思君。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,Two Folk Songs to Send Friends Home,"The mountain is lonely and deserted, and it is gray and full of trees. The dragons are full of the dynasty, what is the king, the empty valley. If you are widowed and think deeply, it is difficult to know the way and act alone. There is a flowing spring on the pleasant stone, and a thatched cottage between the pine trees. Go into the clouds and raise chickens, go up the hill and hold calves. God and dates are like melons, and tigers sell apricots and harvest grains. Ashamed of not being talented and hindering the virtuous, too old and greedy for money. Swear to solve the seal and follow each other, He Zhan Yin Xi He Bu. The people in the mountains are eager to return, the clouds are dark and the rain is falling, and the water is turbulent and green. Egrets are flying suddenly, you can't take off your clothes. There are thousands of mountains and one cloud, and the sky and the earth are indistinguishable. The trees are dark and warm, and the apes are invisible and empty. Suddenly Shanxi is setting sun, and I see Donggao and Yuancun. It is flat and green for thousands of miles, and it is melancholy and misses you."
山水田园,王维,达奚侍郎夫人寇氏挽词二首,唐,束带将朝日，鸣环映牖辰。能令谏明主，相劝识贤人。遗挂空留壁，回文日覆尘。金蚕将画柳，何处更知春？女史悲彤管，夫人罢锦轩。卜茔占二室，行哭度千门。秋日光能淡，寒川波自翻。一朝成万古，松柏暗平原。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,"Two Elegy Poems by Kou Shi, Wife of Daxi Minister","The belt will make the morning sun, and the ringing ring will reflect the Chen. It can make people remonstrate with the Lord and persuade wise men. The leftovers hang empty and stay on the wall, and the palindrome is covered with dust day by day. Golden silkworms will paint willows, where can we know spring better? The female history is sad, and the wife stops Jinxuan. The tomb occupies two rooms, and weeps through thousands of doors. In autumn, the sunlight is weak, and the cold river wave turns itself over. Once a dynasty has become an eternity, pines and cypresses darken the plain."
山水田园,王维,杂诗三首,唐,家住孟津河，门对孟津口。常有江南船，寄书家中否。君自故乡来，应知故乡事。来日绮窗前，寒梅着花未。已见寒梅发，复闻啼鸟声。心心视春草，畏向阶前生。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,Three Miscellaneous Poems,"live in Mengjinhe, and the door is opposite to Mengjinkou. There are often boats in the south of the Yangtze River, whether to send books to the home. You come from your hometown, you should know the things of your hometown. In front of the Qi window in the future, the plum blossoms are not yet in bloom. I have seen cold plum hair, and heard the sound of birds singing again. Looking at the spring grass in my heart, I am afraid of the previous life."
山水田园,王维,田园乐七首,唐,厌见千门万户，经过北里南邻。官府鸣珂有底，崆峒散发何人。再见封侯万户，立谈赐璧一双。讵胜耦耕南亩，何如高卧东窗。采菱渡头风急，策杖林西日斜。杏树坛边渔父，桃花源里人家。萋萋春草秋绿，落落长松夏寒。牛羊自归村巷，童稚不识衣冠。山下孤烟远村，天边独树高原。一瓢颜回陋巷，五柳先生对门。桃红复含宿雨，柳绿更带朝烟。花落家童未埽，莺啼山客犹眠。酌酒会临泉水，抱琴好倚长松。南园露葵朝折，东谷黄粱夜舂。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,Seven pastoral music,"Tired of seeing thousands of families, passing by the north and the south. The official Ming Ke has a bottom line, who is Kongtong distributed? Goodbye Fenghou Wanhu, let's talk about bestowing a pair of biscuits. Ju Sheng couples to plow the south mu, how can he lie high in the east window. Cailing crossing head windy, stick Lin Xi sun slanted. The fisherman by the apricot tree altar is a family in the peach blossom garden. The grass is luxuriant in spring and green in autumn, and the long pines are falling in summer and cold in summer. Cattle and sheep return to the village alleys, childish and ignorant of clothes. At the foot of the mountain, the lonely smoke is far from the village, and the lonely tree plateau is at the edge of the sky. Go back to the alley with a spoonful of face, and Mr. Wuliu is opposite to the door. The peach red contains the rain again, and the willow green brings the smoke of the morning. The flowers fall to the family, and the children are not yet young, and the birds are still asleep. Drinking wine will be near the spring water, holding the piano and leaning against the long pine. The dew sunflowers in the south garden are folded in the morning, and the yellow beams in the east valley are pounded at night."
山水田园,王维,扶南曲歌词五首,唐,翠羽流苏帐，春眠曙不开。羞从面色起，娇逐语声来。早向昭阳殿，君王中使催。堂上青弦动，堂前绮席陈。齐歌卢女曲，双舞洛阳人。倾国徒相看，宁知心所亲。香气传空满，妆华影箔通。歌闻天仗外，舞出御楼中。日暮归何处，花间长乐宫。宫女还金屋，将眠复畏明。入春轻衣好，半夜薄妆成。拂曙朝前殿，玉墀多佩声。朝日照绮窗，佳人坐临镜。散黛恨犹轻，插钗嫌未正。同心勿遽游，幸待春妆竟。,Landscape and pastoral,Wang Wei,Five lyrics of Funan song,"Cuiyu tassel tent, spring sleep dawn not open. The shame starts from the face, and the voice comes from the coquettish voice. Go to Zhaoyang Hall as early as possible, and be urged by the king's envoy. The green strings in the hall are moving, and the seats in front of the hall are Chen. Qi Ge Lu female song, double dance Luoyang people. All the people in the country look at each other, and they would rather know each other. The aroma is full, and the makeup and shadow are clear. The song is heard outside the battle, and dances out of the imperial building. Where does the sun go, the Changle Palace among the flowers. The maid returned the golden house, and she would sleep again and be afraid of the light. It's good to wear light clothes in spring, and make up lightly in the middle of the night. In the front hall at dawn, there are many jade chimes. The morning sun shines on the window, and the beautiful woman sits in the mirror. Sandai's hatred is still light, and the hairpin is not right.

It is better to be safe than evil, and to be loyal. The ape cries continuously on the mountain, but the kite is on tiptoe and the road is difficult to climb.

Returning to Vientiane at the age of one year, Honglong is full of harmony. If you fall into poverty and whoever meets you, let alone your husband. I am ashamed and swollen, thank you for the dwarf. Qi Kuo is ashamed to walk, and stays away from his friends. The pastoral is the same as the Jizi, and the savings are different from Tao Zhu. Fang wanted to show high righteousness, and boasted about bowing to the great witch. Yong Huai vomits liver and gall, still afraid of hindering prosperity and decline.

There are moles hidden in inter-rock caves, and cormorants hidden in bamboos by the lake. There are few pedestrians at sunset in the village market, and the road is unintentionally timid after drunk. Tonight, I should only return to the boarding house, and I will say goodbye to you at dawn in the Ming Dynasty."

Feelings are often intense, and you will forget your feelings. Hehuatun is full of evil spirits, and Yizheng has the sound of war. I am ashamed that there is no way out, thank you for being a teacher. Bingyue knows that kindness is important, but Lin Rong feels that fate is light. The thighs and arms look up to the mountains, and the lips and teeth depend on the Great Wall. Destroy the front in a faint way, and make Yinrong brightly. Lu Lian is a true righteous man, but Lu Xun is not a scholar. Straight to Ning Shuzhi, whip first and then resist. Chu Yun went to the horse with him, and Huaiyue was still in camp. Touching the sword is worthy of scoring, and the sad song is not fair. Always keep promises, and the situation is rampant."

The willows are discolored, and the plum blossoms are full of empty branches. Being in a faraway place is unpredictable, full of worries and worries. This year, people will remember each other day by day, and next year, people will know where they are. One night in Dongshan and thirty springs, I don't know the old wind and dust of books and swords. The dragon bell is also worth two thousand stones, which is ashamed of the people from the east, west, north and south."

If you do it well, you have the essence of thinking, even if you meet by chance, you will become a small comparison, and you will know it well and become a tycoon. Lihou Lihou protects his name, and he loses without complaint. Next year there will be a game of throwing points, who will call first if you don’t?"

Lin Yu overflows the plains of Sichuan, and the caves cover the fields. The way is suitable for Wenyang, and the banquet passes through Luzhou. Looking forward to the suburbs of Qilu forever, the white clouds are so long. Along the Juye Ze, the water flows vertically and horizontally. Insects and snakes embrace a single tree, and elks run on boats. Farming follows the waves, and success in the west is impossible to ask for. The room is full of pillows, and the frog strider is chirping. I still pity the ants floating in the cave, and I am envious of the birds swimming in the clouds. The farmer has nothing to rely on, and the wild old man is worried. The Holy Lord should be benevolent, and the temple will be lucky. The granary will be given to you at last, and the land rent should be stopped. My heart is full of depression, and my travels are also sad. Who is willing to discuss my plan when we are thinking about the current policy."

The military capacity is 300,000, and the national battalion is 1,000 miles. It can be said that it can be said for a moment in its heyday, and the high platform and Quchi will not survive again. There are only traces of foxes in the ruins, and there are no grass and trees left in the ancient land. Mu Tian shook his arms in sorrow, leaning on his sword and singing an elegy to the autumn grass. The knight-errant is still known as Zhu Hai, and pedestrians still know the way of the barbarians. White biscuits and gold are thousands of households, and swords and horses fill the hills. The age is bleak and unquestionable, and the only way to communicate is to flow eastward."
边塞,高适,古歌行,唐,君不见汉家三叶从代至，高皇旧臣多富贵。天子垂衣方晏如，庙堂拱手无馀议。苍生偃卧休征战，露台百金以为费。田舍老翁不出门，洛阳少年莫论事。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Gu Ge Xing,"Don't you see that the three leaves of the Han family have been from generation to generation, and the old officials of the high emperor are so rich and noble. Fang Yanru, the son of heaven hanging down his clothes, has nothing to say about the temple. The common people lie down and go to war, and the terrace is worth a hundred gold. The old man in the farmhouse doesn't go out, and the young man in Luoyang doesn't talk about things."

The family is poor and envied that you have a little salary, so where should you go?"

Passing through the truth of the world, the heart goes beyond the king of emptiness. Ring the bell and the mountain tiger crouches, saying that the Tianlonghui will come. If the meaning is the same, the Sanskrit Dharma is like a melody. Deeply aware of the suffering of billions of kalpas, he is good at describing Hengsha as great. Donate to cut the skin, climb to love. How clean it is to recruit, and the good herds are stationed in the light cover. Crowned among the fragrances, in Linren Jueyuan. Hold the Buddha's seal in your heart for a long time, and the demon army will retreat. May the cause of the beginning of the earth be forever honored."

Ning Zhi's pommel horse is the only thing that can be boarded. The seventh level is Ling Taiqing, and thousands of cliffs are verdant. Piao Piao Fang is eye-catching, imagination sees deep meaning. The joy is not flat, and the cool breeze is blowing. The city is pulled out, the clouds are combined, and the stars are falling. General He Yingling, the officers and soldiers moved the world. Jun Huai gave birth to wings, and originally wanted to attach Qi Ji. It's hard to get ahead if you don't make money, and it's hard to believe in Qingming. After a song of Yangchun, three sighs and finally feel ashamed."

It is said that the work of the military brigade has been reported to be cold in the mountains. The general stopped Panban, and the army spread all over the springs and wells. Preparing for the book outside the room, please be generous in the scene. It can make the honor high and move the fog screen. A long distance can be self-sufficient, but a short step is difficult. When Yuhe looked at it, he began to worry about poverty. The sense of life is like a promise, but it is like a shadow. White hair knows painstaking efforts, Yangchun sees a good place. The stars and rivers are connected, and the mountains are quiet. When recalling the frost and dew, let me lead the way."

There are many elves here, and sometimes there are outstanding talents. Yiren is unique today, and Yisi can be sent out in time. Yonghuai hides the coquettishness, and is always humble for thousands of years. The new stele is also Cui Wei, with good sentences hanging from the sun and the moon. It is the publication of the Stone Classics, which will eventually follow the 梼杌. I come to observe the elegance and change the hair generously. The master of the season is full of licentiousness, and the former king is only a fool. The Eastern Zhou Dynasty was weakened, and the Han Dynasty was even more lost. In the Western Jin Dynasty, He Phi was rampant, and the Wuhu was abrupt. To sing is to show goodness, but to compare things is still to criticize evil. Exclamation will be called, aggressive to it."

The mountains are moving with arrogance, and the Yang army is overturned. The strange soldiers were invited to fight, and the daughter-in-law returned. The spring sprays the blood of the soldiers, and the wind drives away the souls of the captives. The head flies to save thousands of halberds, and the face is tied to the gate of Juyuan. Ghosts cry Huangai at dusk, and the sky worries about day and night. Stone city and rock danger, iron cavalry are all Yuntun. A long-term strategy is decided with one word, and the high track survives for generations. Deterrence of the desert, loyalty to the universe. The old general is dark and colorless, but the Confucian scholars dare to talk about it. Relief depends on the temple, stop killing and repay the king's favor. Only the Guanhe River is slim, and the vast empty tree stumps."
边塞,高适,同房侍御山园新亭与邢判官同游,唐,隐隐春城外，朦胧陈迹深。君子顾榛莽，兴言伤古今。决河导新流，疏径踪旧林。开亭俯川陆，时景宜招寻。肃穆逢使轩，夤缘事登临。忝游芝兰室，还对桃李阴。岸远白波来，气喧黄鸟吟。因睹歌颂作，始知经济心。灌坛有遗风，单父多鸣琴。谁为久州县，苍生怀德音。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,The same room attendant Yushanyuan Xinting and Xing judge travel together,"Faintly outside the spring city, there are deep traces of the past.

When the pavilion is open and overlooks the river and land, it is advisable to search for the time. Su Mu meets the envoy's pavilion, and fate comes to the fore. Visit Zhilan Room, but also Yin Taoli. The shore is far away with white waves coming, and the air is noisy and the yellow birds are singing. Because of seeing the praises, I know the economic heart. There is a legacy in Guantan, and the single father plays the piano more often. Who is Jiuzhou County, the common people Huaideyin."
边塞,高适,同河南李少尹毕员外宅夜饮时洛阳告捷遂作春酒歌,唐,故人美酒胜浊醪，故人清词合风骚。长歌满酌惟吾曹，高谈正可挥麈毛。半醉忽然持蟹螯，洛阳告捷倾前后。武侯腰间印如斗，郎官无事时饮酒。杯中绿蚁吹转来，瓮上飞花拂还有。前年持节将楚兵，去年留司在东京。今年复拜二千石，盛夏五月西南行。彭门剑门蜀山里，昨逢军人劫夺我。到家但见妻与子，赖得饮君春酒数十杯，不然令我愁欲死。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,"When drinking with Li Shaoyin and Bi Yuan from Henan at night in the foreign house, Luoyang won the victory and composed a spring wine song","The old man's fine wine is better than the turbid mash, and the old man's clear words are coquettish. The long song is full of discretion, but I am Cao, and the high talk can be swayed. Half-drunk suddenly holding crab claws, Luoyang is victorious and leaning back and forth. Wuhou's waist is like a bucket, and Lang Guan drinks when he is free. The green ants in the cup are blowing, and the flying flowers on the urn are still there. The year before last, Chu Bing, who held the festival, stayed in Tokyo last year. This year, I will pay homage to the two thousand stones, and travel southwest in May in midsummer. In the Shu Mountains of Pengmen and Jianmen, soldiers robbed me yesterday. When I get home, I see my wife and son, so I have to drink dozens of cups of Junchun wine, otherwise I will die of sorrow."
边塞,高适,同诸公登慈恩寺浮图,唐,香界泯群有，浮图岂诸相。登临骇孤高，披拂欣大壮。言是羽翼生，迥出虚空上。顿疑身世别，乃觉形神王。宫阙皆户前，山河尽檐向。秋风昨夜至，秦塞多清旷。千里何苍苍，五陵郁相望。盛时惭阮步，末宦知周防。输效独无因，斯焉可游放。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Climbing the pagoda of Ci'en Temple with the princes,"The world of incense is obliterated, but the floating map is not the same. Climb to the lonely heights, and feel great and strong. The words are wings, flying out of the void. Suspected of different backgrounds, he is the King of Jue Xing Shen. The palaces and palaces are all in front of the households, and the mountains and rivers are full of eaves. The autumn wind arrived last night, and Qin Saiduo was clear and open. Thousands of miles away, the five tombs look at each other gloomy. In the prime of life, he was ashamed of Ruan Bu, but at the end of the eunuch he knew Zhou Fang. There is no reason for the infusion effect alone, so how can you let it go."

Tongji is happy for a few days, and the playthings are happy. Floating on the waves, Yan Wanzhou is in the middle of the word. In the past, Zhizhi was a plain, but now it is suddenly rippled. It flows to the sea in the east, and flows to Yanhu Lake in the west. The clouds and trees are dark and bright, and the wells and towns are meandering. Returning to the moon with a little sail, if you are in the same period as the sand gull. The fisherman kept me even more, the water in the front pool was not growing."
边塞,高适,同韩四薛三东亭玩月,唐,远游怅不乐，兹赏吾道存。款曲故人意，辛勤清夜言。东亭何寥寥，佳境无朝昏。阶墀近洲渚，户牖当郊原。矧乃穷周旋，游时怡讨论。树阴荡瑶瑟，月气延清尊。明河带飞雁，野火连荒村。对此更愁予，悠哉怀故园。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Playing the moon with Han Sixue Sandong Pavilion,"If you travel far away, you will be unhappy, and I will appreciate my way. The songs are sincere, and the words are hard and clear at night. There are so few east pavilions, and there is no morning and evening in the beautiful scenery. The steps are close to Zhouzhu, and the households are in the suburbs. You Shiyi discusses the situation. The shade of the tree is dangling, and the moon is shining. Minghe brings flying geese, and wildfire connects deserted villages. I am even more worried about this, and I cherish my hometown leisurely."

I even traveled with a group of publics, and I came out of Pingwu in an open space. Layers of yin rise in the dark sea, and the murderous aura is poor and secluded. The hawks and falcons are dancing, calling each other at a gallop. Jackals run wild, and elks are in danger. The tall bird lowers its bow, and the trapped beast fights each other. The dust frightens the big lake and makes the lake dark, and the fire burns deep and the forest withers. If you lose, you will hate, but if you gain, you will have no body. He is clumsy and hates not being a follower. I still cherish the old teachings and sigh this joy."
边塞,高适,同群公秋登琴台,唐,古迹使人感，琴台空寂寥。静然顾遗尘，千载如昨朝。临眺自兹始，群贤久相邀。德与形神高，孰知天地遥。四时何倏忽，六月鸣秋蜩。万象归白帝，平川横赤霄。犹是对夏伏，几时有凉飙。燕雀满檐楹，鸿鹄抟扶摇。物性各自得，我心在渔樵。兀然还复醉，尚握尊中瓢。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,The same group of male autumn on the piano stage,"The monuments are touching, but the Qintai is empty and lonely. Quietly looking at Yichen, thousands of years are like yesterday. Since the beginning of the view, the group of sages has been invited for a long time. Virtue and form are high, who knows the distance between heaven and earth. How sudden is the four o'clock, and the sound of autumn in June. Vientiane belongs to Baidi, and Pingchuan crosses Chixiao. Still facing Xia Fu, when will there be coldness. The eaves are covered with sparrows, and the swans are flying. Each has its own property, and my heart is in fishing and woodcutters. Suddenly, he was still drunk, and he still held the honored ladle."

In the past, he was Nanchang Wei, but now he is a guest of Dongjun. How far away is the relationship with the language, and it is beneficial to know what the heart knows. The autumn forest is clear and open, and the poor alleys are empty. The Butterfly Dance Garden is more leisurely, and the rooster crows day and night. If the man is not satisfied, his way is definitely not suitable. Advise the king and Dumen, don't lament the separation of personnel and affairs."
边塞,高适,同鲜于洛阳于毕员外宅观画马歌,唐,知君爱鸣琴，仍好千里马。永日恒思单父中，有时心到宛城下。遇客丹青天下才，白生胡雏控龙媒。主人娱宾画障开，只言骐骥西极来。半壁䟃?势不住，满堂风飘飒然度。家僮愕视欲先鞭，枥马惊嘶还屡顾。始知物妙皆可怜，燕昭市骏岂徒然。纵令剪拂无所用，犹胜驽骀在眼前。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Watching Horse Songs in Luoyang in Bi Yuan's House with Xian,"Zhijun loves to play the piano, but he still likes a thousand-mile horse. Yongriheng thinks about the single father, and sometimes his heart goes to the city of Wan. When you meet a guest, Danqing is a talented person in the world, and Baisheng Huchu controls the dragon matchmaker. The master entertained the guests and painted barriers, only saying that Qi Ji came to the West. Half the wall? The momentum couldn't hold back, and the wind was blowing all over the room. The family boy stared in astonishment and wanted to whip first, but the Tochi horse neighed in shock and repeatedly looked at it. When I first realized that everything is wonderful, it is pitiful, and Yan Zhao Shijun is in vain. Even if scissors and whisks are useless, it is still better than a scorpion in front of your eyes."

If you are in front of Yaochi, you want to look at Kunlun Hill. Looking back, I see Dai color, and the waves are in the autumn. Deep and towering, clear and shallow, delaying and resisting repair. There are thousands of shadows in the pond, and thousands of rocks on the shore are secluded. It's unpredictable if you don't believe in it, and there's no hidden cast in the deep. The piece of cloud faces the fisherman, and the lone bird follows the empty boat. I send Qingxia in my heart, and I am ashamed of the white gull in the world. Complacency lies in taking pleasure, forgetting is not seeking outside. Good day since many free time, happy and few child tour."

Ge Yu shines on Yagu, his voice is like the waves of the wind. Among Yin Zhenrong's brigades, his achievements competed to praise. Dedicated to the first level of Chen, the army cooks too fast. The captives are bound face-to-face, and the young and old follow their hair. The felt fur is covered with velvet, and the blood is eaten with a smell of mutton. The generals of the Han Dynasty are a trifling matter, and the people of Qin are free to work on their own. Immediately overlooking the Hong River, the startling wind blows the white Artemisia. Yuntun is cold and bitter, and the mountains are high in snow. At the end of the day when the far garrison is at the end of the day, the frontier beacon is connected with the bandit trenches. I am traveling in the rivers and seas, and I will flee with my heart when I die. Once a sense of recommendation, thousands of miles from the handsome. Flying Ming Gai Shulun, bowing to the Cao Cao. Yan Yan knew that there was something to be done, but Longquan did what he did. Xiangshi is ashamed to enter the curtain, and Huaixian is willing to go with him.

There was no strategy at that time, and this place was the frontier garrison. Soldiers and revolutionists are self-diligent, and the mountains and rivers are solid. Take leisure time to enjoy the view, feel the hurt of things and travel. Before the melancholy sunset, I floated far away from the sails. The north wind blows thousands of miles, but the number of southern geese is unknown. Returning to Fang Haoran, Yunsha returned to each other."

Scattering against the floating clouds, Haoge chases after the fisherman. No matter how caring about flaws and cheapness, they are willing to get along with each other. Geng Jie came out of the Xiansi and met the group of officials generously. Compose poems to perceive oneself, fight for ignorance independently. Who does not look up to gold and stone, the waves are endless. A small body is in vain and multi-valued, and a dead wood is ashamed of a good workmanship. The general expanded the frontier to the west, and Bo Caiyi joined the army. Regardless of Jidai's heart, I would like to imitate the husband. Hualiu is full of long soap, and the weak he is surrounded by carved cages. The march moves like flying, and the rotation is strict.

Filial piety king Yu Jingjing, Weizi's old Tianchou. The winter solstice is swaggering, and the weather is cold. The rain and snow fly in the ape rock, and the catalpa falls in the rabbit garden.

You can travel thousands of miles with ease, and talk about nine streams. The poem titled the sapphire case, and the clothes were presented with sable fur. The cars in the poor alleys are quiet, and the eyes and ears are worried about the leisurely fasting. I can't play Fang Guanle, but I want to admire Chaoyou.

Mud smears surround the city walls, and water floods the Panqiu ruins. Melancholy and sympathetic to Tian Nong, Pei Hui hurts Lilu. It used to be the tax of Lijing, but it was the reserve of Wudou. Everything is in the heart, and I think about writing for ten years. Jun's gate is humble, and his body is thoughtful. Thinking about Gu Caomao, depressed Ren Yingxu. The yellow swan is not enviable, and it rises when the rooster crows. On the side of the old man's platform, the Gaoguan is adjacent to the thoroughfare. Brother Fang Xunchen is as talented as Xu.

At first glance, I can sing wildly in the grass, but I would rather be an official in the dust. It is said that Xiaoyi does nothing, and everything in the public house is expected. It is heartbreaking to welcome the official, and it is sad to whip Li Shu. When I came back, I asked my wife at home, and the whole family laughed like this. Things should be done in the south, and the world should be paid to the water in the east. I dream that the old mountain is safe and sound, and I will return late for the title of king.

It is said that there are tens of thousands of riders on the battlefield, and Yu Shu arrived at Bian Ting yesterday.

Yellow clouds and white grass have no front and back, and the court is built and the evening is stubborn. There are many young men under the plug, but there are no spring willows in Kansai. When you join the army, ask who you are from, and fencing and singing are at this time. Far from having no policy to circumvent the court lightly, Pingrong sent Zhongxuan poems early."

In summer, the day is like fire, and there is no driving in the extreme. The long road leaves Lei Ze, and the floating clouds return to Meng Zhu. There are 100,000 families in Wei County, and the singing and bells are noisy. It is preached that the virtuous king arrives, and Chang Yanru retreats.

What happened to the husband is unknown, so is the case with both the master and the father. I'm rubbing against nothing today, let's see what you can do."
边塞,高适,钜鹿赠李少府,唐,李侯虽薄宦，时誉何籍籍。骏马常借人，黄金每留客。投壶华馆静，纵酒凉风夕。即此遇神仙，吾欣知损益。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Julu presented Li Shaofu,"Although Li Hou was a poor eunuch, where was his reputation at that time? Horses often borrow people, but gold always keeps guests. Throwing pots, Hua Guan is quiet, and the wine is cool and windy. That is to say, when I meet a god, I am glad to know the profit and loss."
边塞,高适,哭单父梁九少府,唐,开箧泪沾臆，见君前日书。夜台今寂寞，独是子云居。畴昔探云奇，登临赋山水。同舟南浦下，望月西江里。契阔多别离，绸缪到生死。九原即何处，万事皆如此。晋山徒峨峨，斯人已冥冥。常时禄且薄，殁后家复贫。妻子在远道，弟兄无一人。十上多苦辛，一官恒自哂。青云将可致，白日忽先尽。唯有身后名，空留无远近。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Cry Single Father Liang Jiu Shaofu,"Open the suitcase with tears in my eyes, and see the book from the day before yesterday. The night stage is lonely today, and Ziyun lives alone. In the past, explore the clouds and wonders, and visit the landscape. In the same boat under Nanpu, looking at the moon in the West River. Qi Kuoduo parted ways and prepared for life and death. Where is Jiuyuan, everything is like this. Jinshan Tue'e, the Sri Lankan people are already dead. Often the salary is poor, and the family returns to poverty after death. The wife is far away, and the brother has no one. It's been a lot of hard work for ten people, and one official is always self-satisfied. Qingyun will be able to reach, but the day will be exhausted first. There is only the name after death, leaving no distance."
边塞,高适,哭裴少府,唐,世人谁不死，嗟君非生虑。扶病适到官，田园在何处？公才群吏感，葬事他人助。余亦未识君，深悲哭君去。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,cry Pei Shaofu,"Who in the world is not dead, I regret that you are not worried. Where is the pastoral land when you get sick and go to the government? Public talents and officials feel that others help in funerals. Yu also didn't know you, so I cried deeply for you to go."
边塞,高适,宴韦司户山亭院,唐,人幽想灵山，意惬怜远水。习静务为适，所居还复尔。汲流涨华池，开酌宴君子。苔径试窥践，石屏可攀倚。入门见中峰，携手如万里。横琴了无事，垂钓应有以。高馆何沈沈，飒然凉风起。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Banquet Weisi Hu Shanting Yard,"People think about Lingshan, and feel comfortable and pity the distant water. It is appropriate to practice static affairs, and the residence is still complex. Drain the flow of the Huachi, and open a feast for gentlemen. The moss path is a peep, and the stone screen can be climbed. See Zhongfeng at the beginning, hand in hand is like thousands of miles. Hengqin is fine, fishing should be possible. The high hall is heavy, and the cool breeze blows."
边塞,高适,效古赠崔二,唐,十月河洲时，一看有归思。风飙生惨烈，雨雪暗天地。我辈今胡为，浩哉迷所至。缅怀当涂者，济济居声位。邈然在云霄，宁肯更沦踬。周旋多燕乐，门馆列车骑。美人芙蓉姿，狭室兰麝气。金炉陈兽炭，谈笑正得意。岂论草泽中，有此枯槁士。我惭经济策，久欲甘弃置。君负纵横才，如何尚憔悴。长歌增郁怏，对酒不能醉。穷达自有时，夫子莫下泪。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Xiao Gu presents Cui Er,"When I was at Hezhou in October, I thought about it when I saw it. The wind is violent, and the rain and snow are dark. I have done nothing in this generation, and I am so confused. In memory of those who were painted, they are in the top position. Miaoran is in the sky, I would rather be stunned. There are many Yanle music in the circle, and the gate train rides. The beauty is hibiscus, and the orchid musk is narrow. The golden furnace is Chen Beast Charcoal, talking and laughing proudly. No matter in the grass, there is such a withered man. I am ashamed of the economic policy, and I am willing to abandon it for a long time. How can you still be haggard if you lose your talents. Changge is more depressed, and you can't get drunk with wine. When you are poor, don't cry."
边塞,高适,涟上别王秀才,唐,飘飖经远道，客思满穷秋。浩荡对长涟，君行殊未休。崎岖山海侧，想像无前俦。何意照乘珠，忽然欲暗投。东路方萧条，楚歌复悲愁。暮帆使人感，去鸟兼离忧。行矣当自爱，壮年莫悠悠。余亦从此辞，异乡难久留。赠言岂终极，慎勿滞沧洲。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Farewell Wang Xiucai,"Flying through the long distance, the guest thinks about the poor autumn. The mighty is against Changlian, and the king's line has not stopped. On the side of the rugged mountains and seas, the imagination is unprecedented. He Yizhao rides the bead, and suddenly wants to cast secretly. The East Road is depressed, and Chu Ge is sad again. Evening sails are touching, and the birds are gone and the worries are gone. When it's done, love yourself, don't be careless when you are in your prime. Yu also resigned from now on, and it is difficult to stay in a foreign land for a long time. Words are not the ultimate, be careful not to stagnate in Cangzhou."
边塞,高适,涟上题樊氏水亭,唐,涟上非所趣，偶为世务牵。经时驻归棹，日夕对平川。莫论行子愁，且得主人贤。亭上酒初熟，厨中鱼每鲜。自说宦游来，因之居住偏。煮盐沧海曲，种稻长淮边。四时常晏如，百口无饥年。菱芋藩篱下，渔樵耳目前。异县少朋从，我行复迍邅。向不逢此君，孤舟已言旋。明日又分首，风涛还眇然。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Lian Shang Title Fan's Water Pavilion,"Lian Shang is not interested, and occasionally leads to world affairs. After time, I will return to Zhao, facing Pingchuan day and night. Don't worry about your son's worries, but get the master's sage. The wine in the pavilion is first cooked, and the fish in the kitchen is fresh. He said that he came from an official tour, so he lived in a partial place. Boil salt Canghaiqu, grow rice along the Huai River. At four o'clock, Chang Yanru, the whole family has no hunger for years. Under the taro fence, fishermen and woodcutters are present. A few friends from other counties follow, and we will go back to Bing. If I don't meet this gentleman, the lonely boat has already said. Tomorrow they will split up again, and the wind and waves are still in the air."
边塞,高适,留别郑三韦九兼洛下诸公,唐,忆昨相逢论久要，顾君哂我轻常调。羁旅虽同白社游，诗书已作青云料。蹇质蹉跎竟不成，年过四十尚躬耕。长歌达者杯中物，大笑前人身后名。幸逢明盛多招隐，高山大泽徵求尽。此时亦得辞渔樵，青袍裹身荷圣朝。犁牛钓竿不复见，县人邑吏来相邀。远路鸣蝉秋兴发，华堂美酒离忧销。不知何日更携手，应念兹晨去折腰。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Farewell to Zheng Sanwei Jiu and the Lords of Luoxia,"Reminiscing about the long time we met yesterday, Gu Jun sneered at me and tuned me lightly. Although Jilv traveled with Baishe, his poems and books have already been made into Qingyun materials. Jian quality wasted and failed, and he was still working hard after forty years old. The thing in the cup of the long song master, the name of the predecessor and the behind. Fortunately, there are many hidden people in the Ming Dynasty, and the mountains and rivers are all solicited. At this time, I also had to resign from the fishing and woodcutters, and wrapped myself in a green robe in the Holy Dynasty. The plow ox and the fishing rod are no longer seen, and the county officials come to invite them. The cicadas are buzzing in the long distance, and the autumn is prosperous, and the fine wine in Huatang is sold out from worries. I don't know when we will join hands again, I should read this morning and bend over."
边塞,高适,途中酬李少府赠别之作,唐,西上逢节换，东征私自怜。故人今卧疾，欲别还留连。举酒临南轩，夕阳满中筵。宁知江上兴，乃在河梁偏。行李多光辉，札翰忽相鲜。谁谓岁月晚，交情尚贞坚。终嗟州县劳，官谤复迍邅。虽负忠信美，其如方寸悬。连帅扇清风，千里犹眼前。曾是趋藻镜，不应翻弃捐。日来知自强，风气殊未痊。可以加药物，胡为辄忧煎。驱马出大梁，原野一悠然。柳色感行客，云阴愁远天。皇明烛幽遐，德泽普照宣。鹓鸿列霄汉，燕雀何翩翩。余亦惬所从，渔樵十二年。种瓜漆园里，凿井卢门边。去去勿重陈，生涯难勉旃。或期遇春事，与尔复周旋。投报空回首，狂歌谢比肩。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,A farewell work for Li Shaofu on the way,"In the west, there are festivals and festivals, and in the east, there is self-pity. The old man is sick now, and he lingers if he wants to leave. Raise wine to Linnanxuan, and the sunset is full of feasts. Ning knows that Jiang Shangxing is on the side of Heliang. The luggage is so brilliant, but Zhahan suddenly looks different. Who says that the years are late, but the friendship is still strong. In the end, he lamented the work of the state and county, and the officials slandered him again. Although it bears loyalty and beauty, it is like hanging by an inch. Lian Shuai fanned the breeze, thousands of miles away. It used to be a algae mirror, so it should not be turned over and discarded. Days to learn self-improvement, the atmosphere is not cured. Drugs can be added, and it will be decocted for worry. Drive the horse out of the girder, and the wilderness is leisurely. The willow color is a traveler, and the clouds are cloudy and worry about the distant sky. The emperor's bright candle is secluded, and Dezepu illuminates it. The scorpion is listed in the sky, and the chick is graceful. Yu Yiyi followed, fishing and woodcutter for twelve years. In the lacquer garden of planting melons, beside the Lumen well. Don't repeat the past and the past, life is difficult. Or in case of spring events, I will deal with you again. Returning to the empty report, singing wildly and thanking each other shoulder to shoulder."
边塞,高适,崔司录宅燕大理李卿,唐,多雨殊未已，秋云更沈沈。洛阳故人初解印，山东小吏来相寻。上卿才大名不朽，早朝至尊暮求友。豁达常推海内贤，殷勤但酌尊中酒。饮醉欲言归剡溪，门前驷马光照衣。路傍观者徒唧唧，我公不以为是非。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Cui Silu Zhaiyan Dali Li Qing,"It's rainy, but the autumn clouds are even more heavy. The old man in Luoyang first released the seal, and a small official from Shandong came to look for him. Shangqingcai's name is immortal, and he seeks friends in the morning and evening. Open-minded often promotes virtuous people in the world, diligent but respectful of wine. Drunken and wanting to return to Shanxi, four horses in front of the gate shine on the clothes. The onlookers by the side of the road are just chirping, and I don't think it's right or wrong."
边塞,高适,淇上别刘少府子英,唐,近来住淇上，萧条惟空林。又非耕种时，闲散多自任。伊君独知我，驱马欲招寻。千里忽携手，十年同苦心。求仁见交态，于道喜甘临。逸思乃天纵，微才应陆沈。飘然归故乡，不复问离襟。南登黎阳渡，莽苍寒云阴。桑叶原上起，河淩山下深。途穷更远别，相对益悲吟。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Farewell to Liu Shaofu Ziying on Qi,"Living in Qishang recently, the only depression is the empty forest. And when it is not farming, idleness is more self-responsible. Yijun knows me alone, and he drives his horse to find him. Thousands of miles suddenly join hands, ten years of painstaking efforts. Seeking benevolence to see each other, and Yu Daoxi is willing to come. Yisi is the will of the sky, and small talents should respond to Lu Shen. Floating back to my hometown, I no longer ask about leaving the lapel. Ascending to Liyang Ferry in the south, it is wild and cold and cloudy. The mulberry leaf plain rises from the top, and the Heling mountain goes deep down. If the road is poor, it will be farther away, and it will be more sad."
边塞,高适,渔父歌,唐,曲岸深潭一山叟，驻眼看钩不移手。世人欲得知姓名，良久问他不开口。笋皮笠子荷叶衣，心无所营守钓矶。料得孤舟无定止，日暮持竿何处归。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,fisherman song,"There is an old man on the mountain in the deep pool on the bank of the river, standing still and watching the hook without moving his hand. People wanted to know his name, but they asked him for a long time without opening his mouth. Bamboo bamboo shoots, hats, lotus leaf clothes, and nothing to guard the fishing rocks. It is expected that the lonely boat will never stop, and where will it return with the pole at dusk."
边塞,高适,登广陵栖灵寺塔,唐,淮南富登临，兹塔信奇最。直上造云族，凭虚纳天籁。迥然碧海西，独立飞鸟外。始知高兴尽，适与赏心会。连山黯吴门，乔木吞楚塞。城池满窗下，物象归掌内。远思驻江帆，暮时结春霭。轩车疑蠢动，造化资大块。何必了无身，然后知所退。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Climbing the Pagoda of Qiling Temple in Guangling Mausoleum,"Huainan Fudenglin, Zita Xinqi the most. Go straight up to build the cloud family, and accept the sounds of nature with emptiness. It is quite different from Bihaixi, independent of Asuka. I know that I am happy, and I will be comfortable and enjoyable. Lianshan darkened Wumen, and trees swallowed Chusai. The city is full of windows, and the objects are in the palm. Thinking far away from the sails stationed in the river, and forming a spring mist at dusk. The Xuan car is suspiciously moving, making a lot of money. Why bother to have no body, and then know what to retreat."
边塞,高适,登百丈峰二首 其一,唐,朝登百丈峰，遥望燕支道。汉垒青冥间，胡天白如扫。忆昔霍将军，连年此征讨。匈奴终不灭，寒山徒草草。唯见鸿雁飞，令人伤怀抱。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Climbing Baizhang Peak is the first of two,"Climb to Baizhang Peak and look at Yanzhi Road in the distance. Between Han Lei and Qing Ming, Hu Tian is as white as sweeping. Reminiscing about General Huo's past, he has fought this campaign year after year. The Xiongnu will never die, and the cold mountains will be nothing but grass. Seeing swan geese flying makes one feel sad."
边塞,高适,登垄,唐,垄头远行客，垄上分流水。流水无尽期，行人未云已。浅才登一命，孤剑通万里。岂不思故乡，从来感知己。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Denglong,"Travelers on the ridge head divert water from the ridge. The flowing water is endless, and the pedestrians are not clouded. Qiancai boarded a life, and a lone sword can reach thousands of miles. Don't you think of your hometown and always feel yourself."
边塞,高适,答侯少府,唐,常日好读书，晚年学垂纶。漆园多乔木，睢水清粼粼。诏书下柴门，天命敢逡巡。赫赫三伏时，十日到咸秦。褐衣不得见，黄绶翻在身。吏道顿羁束，生涯难重陈。北使经大寒，关山饶苦辛。边兵若刍狗，战骨成埃尘。行矣勿复言，归欤伤我神。如何燕赵陲，忽遇平生亲。开馆纳征骑，弹弦娱远宾。飘飖天地间，一别方兹晨。东道有佳作，南朝无此人。性灵出万象，风骨超常伦。吾党谢王粲，群贤推郤诜。明时取秀才，落日过蒲津。节苦名已富，禄微家转贫。相逢愧薄游，抚己荷陶钧。心事正堪尽，离居宁太频。两河归路遥，二月芳草新。柳接滹沱暗，莺连渤海春。谁谓行路难，猥当希代珍。提握每终日，相思犹比邻。江海有扁舟，丘园有角巾。君意定何适，我怀知所遵。浮沈各异宜，老大贵全真。莫作云霄计，遑遑随缙绅。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Answer Hou Shaofu,"like reading on weekdays, and learn fishing in my later years. There are many trees in the lacquer garden, and the water is clear and sparkling. The imperial edict is issued to Caimen, and the destiny dares to patrol. During the three volts, he arrived in Xianqin on the tenth. The brown clothes are not visible, and the yellow ribbons are turned on the body. Officials are restrained, and life is difficult to repeat. The northern envoys went through the great cold, and Guan Shanrao worked hard. Frontier soldiers are like humble dogs, and the bones of battle are like dust. Don't repeat your words after you have done it, it hurts my god to return. How Yanzhao frontier suddenly met a lifelong relative. Open the museum to accept horses and play strings to entertain guests from far away. Floating between the heaven and the earth, a farewell to Fang Zichen. There are excellent works in Dongdao, but there is no such person in the Southern Dynasties. The spirit is out of everything, and the strength of character is extraordinary. Our party thanked Wang Can, but all the sages rejected Shen. Take scholars in the Ming Dynasty, and pass Pujin in the sunset. Jie Kuming has become rich, and Lu Wei's family has become poor. When you meet, you are ashamed and thin, and you caress yourself and Tao Jun. I can't bear to worry about everything, and I leave Juning too frequently. The two rivers return to the road far away, and the grass is new in February. Willows meet Hutuo dark, and warblers connect Bohai spring. Whoever says that the road is difficult, is obscene as Xidaizhen. Holding hands every day, lovesickness is still close to each other. There are flat boats in Jianghai, and horn scarves in Qiuyuan. What is the king's will, I know what to follow. The ups and downs are different, and the boss is all true. Don't play tricks, let alone follow the gentry."
边塞,高适,赋得还山吟送沈四山人,唐,还山吟，天高日暮寒山深。送君还山识君心，人生老大须恣意。看君解作一生事，山间偃仰无不至。石泉淙淙若风雨，桂花松子常满地。卖药囊中应有钱，还山服药又长年。白云劝尽杯中物，明月相随何处眠。眠时忆问醒时事，梦魂可以相周旋。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Fu De Huan Shan Yin sends Shen Si Shanren,"Returning to the mountain chant, the sky is high, the sun is setting, and the mountains are deep. Sending you back to the mountain to know your heart, the boss of life must be willful. Look at the king's interpretation of everything in his life, and the mountains are all over the place. The stone spring is murmuring like wind and rain, and the ground is often covered with sweet-scented osmanthus and pine nuts. There should be money in the medicine bag, and it takes years to return to the mountain to take medicine. Baiyun persuades to use up all the contents of the cup, where does the bright moon follow to sleep. When I sleep, I recall the current events when I wake up, and the dream and soul can deal with each other."
边塞,高适,遇冲和先生,唐,冲和生何代，或谓游东溟。三命谒金殿，一言拜银青。自云多方术，往往通神灵。万乘亲问道，六宫无敢听。昔去限霄汉，今来睹仪形。头戴鹖鸟冠，手遥白鹤翎。终日饮醇酒，不醉复不醒。常忆鸡鸣山，每诵西升经。拊背念离别，依然出户庭。莫见今如此，曾为一客星。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Mr. Yu Chonghe,"Chong Hesheng He Dai, or You Dongming. Three orders to pay homage to the Golden Palace, and one word to pay homage to Yin Qing. Since the clouds have many alchemy techniques, they often communicate with the gods. Wan Cheng asked, but Liugong dared not listen. In the past, I went to limit Xiaohan, but now I come to see the shape of the instrument. He wears a pheasant crown on his head and holds a white crane feather in his hand. Drink alcohol all day long, never get drunk and never wake up again. I often recall Jiming Mountain, and every time I recite the Xisheng Sutra. I read farewell, but still go out of the house. Don't see this like this, he was once a guest star."
边塞,高适,遇崔二有别,唐,大国多任士，明时遗此人。颐颔尚丰盈，毛骨未合迍。逸足望千里，商歌悲四邻。谁谓多才富，却令家道贫。秋风吹别马，携手更伤神。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Meeting Cui Er is different,"There are many scholars in a big country, and this person will be left in the Ming Dynasty. The chin is still plump, and the bones are not yet healed. Looking at thousands of miles with ease, Shang Ge is sad for the neighbors. Who says that many talents are rich, but make the family poor. The autumn wind blows away the horse, and it is even more sad to join hands."
边塞,高适,鲁西至东平,唐,沙岸拍不定，石桥水横流。问津见鲁俗，怀古伤家丘。寥落千载后，空传褒圣侯。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Luxi to Dongping,"The beach is uncertain, and the water on the stone bridge is flowing. See Lu vulgarity when you ask about Jinjin, and hurt Jiaqiu when you nostalgia for the past. After thousands of years, there is no mention of praise to the Holy Marquis."
边塞,高适,鲁郡途中遇徐十八录事,唐,谁谓嵩颍客，遂经邹鲁乡。前临少昊墟，始觉东蒙长。独行岂吾心，怀古激中肠。圣人久已矣，游夏遥相望。裴回野泽间，左右多悲伤。日出见阙里，川平知汶阳。弱冠负高节，十年思自强。终然不得意，去去任行藏。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,"On the way to Lu County, I met Xu Shiba's recorder","Who is called a songying guest, then passed through Zoulu Township. Proceeding to the Shaohao Ruins, I began to feel that Eastern Mongolia was long. Walking alone is not my heart, nostalgia stimulates the intestines. The saint has passed away for a long time, and You Xia looks at each other from a distance. Pei returned to Nozawa, left and right sad. See Que at sunrise, Chuanping knows Wenyang. Weak crown and high integrity, ten years of self-improvement. In the end, I was not satisfied, so I went to Ren Xingzang."
边塞,高适,塞上,唐,东出卢龙塞，浩然客思孤。亭堠列万里，汉兵犹备胡。边尘涨北溟，虏骑正南驱。转斗岂长策，和亲非远图。惟昔李将军，按节出皇都。总戎扫大漠，一战擒单于。常怀感激心，愿效纵横谟。倚剑欲谁语，关河空郁纡。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,stuffed,"Going out of Lulongsai in the east, the Haoran guest thinks of loneliness. The pavilions are thousands of miles away, and the Han soldiers are still prepared. The dust on the border rose to the north, and the captives drove to the south. Turning to fight is not a long-term strategy, and getting married is not a long-term plan. But in the past, General Li left the imperial capital according to the festival. The general army swept the desert and captured Shanyu in one battle. I am always grateful and willing to follow the example of Zonghengmo. Leaning on the sword, whoever wants to speak, Guanhe is empty and gloomy."
边塞,高适,塞下曲,唐,结束浮云骏，翩翩出从戎。且凭天子怒，复倚将军雄。万鼓雷殷地，千旗火生风。日轮驻霜戈，月魄悬雕弓。青海阵云匝，黑山兵气冲。战酣太白高，战罢旄头空。万里不惜死，一朝得成功。画图骐麟阁，入朝明光宫。大笑向文士，一经何足穷。古人昧此道，往往成老翁。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,next song,"After the end of Floating Cloud Jun, Pianpian came out to join the army. And relying on the anger of the emperor, he will rely on the general Xiong again. Thousands of drums are thundering on the ground, and thousands of flags are burning with fire. The sun wheel stays in the frost, and the moon soul hangs the carved bow. Qinghai is full of clouds, and the soldiers of Montenegro are angry. The battle is too high, and the battle is over, and the head is empty. Thousands of miles are not hesitating to die, and once you succeed. Draw a picture of Qilin Pavilion and enter Mingguang Palace. Laugh at the scribes, how poor they are once. The ancients were ignorant of this way and often became old men."
边塞,高适,塞下曲 贺兰作,唐,君不见芳树枝，春花落尽蜂不窥。君不见梁上泥，秋风始高燕不栖。荡子从军事征战，蛾眉婵娟守空闺。独宿自然堪下泪，况复时闻鸟夜啼。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,The next song He Lan wrote,"If you don't see the fragrant branches, the spring flowers are all gone, and the bees don't peep. Don't you see the mud on the beams, the autumn wind begins to be high and the swallows don't live. The prodigal son fights in the military, and the crescent-browed Chanjuan guards the empty boudoir. Sleeping alone is naturally worthy of tears, and when the situation returns, I hear birds singing at night."
边塞,高适,睢阳酬别畅大判官,唐,吾友遇知己，策名逢圣朝。高才擅白雪，逸翰怀青霄。承诏选嘉宾，慨然即驰轺。清昼下公馆，尺书忽相邀。留欢惜别离，毕景驻行镳。言及沙漠事，益令胡马骄。丈夫拔东蕃，声冠霍嫖姚。兜鍪冲矢石，铁甲生风飙。诸将出冷陉，连营济石桥。酋豪尽俘馘，子弟输征徭。边庭绝刁斗，战地成渔樵。榆关夜不扃，塞口长萧萧。降胡满蓟门，一一能射雕。军中多宴乐，马上何轻趫。戎狄本无厌，羁縻非一朝。饥附诚足用，饱飞安可招。李牧制儋蓝，遗风岂寂寥。君还谢幕府，慎勿轻刍荛。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Suiyang pays farewell to the magistrate,"When my friend meets a confidant, the policy name meets the Holy Dynasty. Gao Cai is good at Baixue, Yihan is pregnant with Qingxiao. Chengzhao selects the guests, and he is full of emotion. When I went to the mansion in the early afternoon, I was suddenly invited by Chishu. Staying happy and cherishing parting, Bi Jing stays and walks. When it comes to desert matters, it makes Hu Ma proud. Husband pulls out Dongfan, and is known as Huo whoring Yao. Going against the arrow and rock, the iron armor makes the wind blow. All the generals went out of Lengxing, and joined camp to help the stone bridge. The chieftains are all captured, and the children are lost and conscripted. The border court is extremely fierce, and the battlefield becomes fishermen and woodcutters. Yuguan is not closed at night, and the mouth of the gate is long Xiaoxiao. Jianghu is full of Jimen, and can shoot eagles one by one. There are many banquets in the army, so why don't you take off immediately. Rong Di is insatiable, and he is not a dynasty. Hunger and sincerity are sufficient, and fullness can be recruited. Li Mu made Danlan, how can the legacy be lonely. You also thank the shogunate, be careful not to underestimate the shovel."
边塞,高适,蓟门不遇王之涣郭密之因以留赠,唐,适远登蓟丘，兹晨独搔屑。贤交不可见，吾愿终难说。迢递千里游，羁离十年别。才华仰清兴，功业嗟芳节。旷荡阻云海，萧条带风雪。逢时事多谬，失路心弥折。行矣勿重陈，怀君但愁绝。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Jimen did not meet Wang Zhihuan and Guo Mizhi as a gift,"Shiyuan climbed Jiqiu, scratching the crumbs alone in the morning. The virtuous friends are invisible, and my wish is hard to say. Travel thousands of miles away, and leave for ten years. Talent Yangqing Xing, achievement sigh Fangjie. The openness blocks the sea of clouds, and the depression brings wind and snow. There are many absurdities in current times, and the heart is broken when you lose your way. Don't repeat the statement when it's done, but worry about the king."

边塞,高适,蓟中作,唐,策马自沙漠，长驱登塞垣。边城何萧条，白日黄云昏。一到征战处，每愁胡虏翻。岂无安边书，诸将已承恩。惆怅孙吴事，归来独闭门。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Zuo Zhongzuo,"Ride the horse from the desert, and drive to the Saiyuan. How depressed the border town is, the day is yellow and the clouds are dark. Once at the battle place, every time I worry about the Hu captives turning over.

At this time, I will say goodbye to you, shaking hands and wanting to be speechless."

Climbing high and overlooking the sea, looking back weep like hail. The same person has been parted for a long time, and we still meet when we lose our way. Xue Houhuai said straightly that Deye should be selected at the right time. Cai Zi was a Qing talent, and was recommended by guests in those days. Han Gong has strange festivals, and his poems are written by Ling Qunyan. During the study of Song Cen, he was an official in Canghaidian. Yi Yu is a widow, and I am grateful and stunned. Longitudinal birth is not your love, and you will fall into the trap of being cheap. Qiongyao's work was suddenly in vain, and he was a family member of his life. At the beginning, it was said that my way survived, but in the end I was tired of traveling. There is no day and night in the heart, nothing else but a banquet. When the cool wind returns, the vast summer clouds change."

Reminiscing about Gao Qiuxing, I am suddenly in vain. I am tired of feeling things, and the cool wind frightens Ermao. Chi Kuhan dies, and the moon rises as high as the phoenix trees.

Unique Jiang Haixin, leisurely never tired."
边塞,高适,酬李少府,唐,出塞魂屡惊，怀贤意难说。谁知吾道间，乃在客中别。日夕捧琼瑶，相思无休歇。伊人虽薄宦，举代推高节。述作凌江山，声华满冰雪。一登蓟丘上，四顾何惨烈。来雁无尽时，边风正骚屑。将从崖谷遁，且与沈浮绝。君若登青云，余当投魏阙。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Reward Li Shaofu,"The soul of the fortress is repeatedly shocked, and it's hard to say what it means to be virtuous. Who knows that my way is farewell among the guests. Holding Qiong Yao day and night, lovesickness never stops. Although the Yiren are poor eunuchs, they push up the integrity from generation to generation. Described as Lingjiang Mountain, the sound is full of ice and snow. As soon as I climbed on Jiqiu, I looked around so tragically. When the geese come endlessly, the side wind is blowing away. I will flee from the cliffs and valleys, and I will never go up and down. If the king ascends to Qingyun, Yu should vote for Wei Que."

Don't worry about being in the mountains, go back to the original place on the journey. Xiao Xiao went to the entrance of the village, only to see Zhuan Peng enter. The people of Shuizhu leave late, and the geese fly in the frosty sky. It should not be far away, and the road is out of reach. If you want to go to the river to get on the boat, Acacia stands empty."
边塞,高适,酬庞十兵曹,唐,忆昔游京华，自言生羽翼。怀书访知己，末路空相识。许国不成名，还家有惭色。托身从?亩，浪迹初自得。雨泽感天时，耕耘忘帝力。同人洛阳至，问我睢水北。遂尔款津涯，净然见胸臆。高谈悬物象，逸韵投翰墨。别岸迥无垠，海鹤鸣不息。梁城多古意，携手共悽恻。怀贤想邹枚，登高思荆棘。世情恶疵贱，之子怜孤直。酬赠感并深，离忧岂终极。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Reward Pang Shibing Cao,"Reminiscing about traveling in Beijing in the past, I said that I had wings. Visiting confidantes with books in their arms, meeting each other in the end. Xu Guo is not famous, and he is ashamed to return home. Relying on his body from his mu, he was proud of his wanderings. Yuze feels the weather and forgets the power of Dili when he cultivates. The colleague came to Luoyang and asked me about the north of Sui Shui. Sui Er paid for Jin Ya, but he saw his heart clearly. Eloquent talk about hanging objects and images, and Yiyun cast pen and ink. The other shore is far away, and the sea and cranes are endless. Liangcheng is so old-fashioned, hand in hand to share the sorrow. Huaixian thinks of Zou Mei, and thinks of thorns when climbing high. The world is evil and cheap, and the son is pity and upright. The sense of reward is not deep, and the worry is the ultimate."
边塞,高适,酬秘书弟兼寄幕下诸公,唐,亚相膺时杰，群才遇良工。翩翩幕下来，拜赐甘泉宫。信知命世奇，适会非常功。侍御执邦宪，清词焕春丛。末路望绣衣，他时常发蒙。孰云三军壮，惧我弹射雄。谁谓万里遥，在我樽俎中。光禄经济器，精微自深衷。前席屡荣问，长城兼在躬。高纵激颓波，逸翮驰苍穹。将副节制筹，欲令沙漠空。司业志应徐，雅度思冲融。相思三十年，忆昨犹儿童。今来抱青紫，忽若披鹓鸿。说剑增慷慨，论交持始终。秘书即吾门，虚白无不通。多才陆平原，硕学郑司农。献封到关西，独步归山东。永意久知处，嘉言能亢宗。客从梁宋来，行役随转蓬。酬赠欣元弟，忆贤瞻数公。游鳞戏沧浪，鸣凤栖梧桐。并负垂天翼，俱乘破浪风。眈眈天府间，偃仰谁敢同。何意搆广厦，翻然顾雕虫。应知阮步兵，惆怅此途穷。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Remuneration to my younger brother and send to all the princes under the curtain,"Yaxiang is honored by Shijie, and group talents meet good workers. Pianpian curtain down, thanks to Oasis Palace. Believe in the knowledge of life and the world, it will be very successful. Serving the imperial court and governing the state constitution, Qing Ci Huanchun Cong. Looking at the embroidered clothes at the end, he often gets confused. Who says the three armies are strong, fearing that I will shoot the heroes. Who is said to be thousands of miles away is in my pocket. Guanglu economical device is subtle and sincere. The front seats are repeatedly asked, and the Great Wall is also bowing. The high vertical shocks the decadent waves, and the Yi He gallops into the sky. The secondary moderation will be raised, and the desert will be empty. The company's ambitions should be Xu, and Yadusi should be in harmony. Thirty years of lovesickness, remembering yesterday is still a child. Today, when I come to embrace cyanosis, it suddenly looks like a bird. It is said that the sword increases generosity, and it is always about the confrontation. The secretary is our door, and there is nothing wrong with nothing. Lu Pingyuan is talented, and Zheng Sinong is a master. Dedicated to Kansai, and returned to Shandong alone. Knowing the place for a long time, good words can be strong. The guests came from the Liang and Song Dynasties, and the service followed the transfer. Reward Xin Yuan's younger brother, Yi Xian Zhan Shu Gong. Swimming scales play Canglang, singing phoenixes live in phoenix trees. And bear the wings of the sky, and ride the waves and wind. Staring at the sky, who dares to be the same. Why do you want to build a wide mansion, and then look at the bugs. You should know that Ruan infantry is sad that this journey is poor."
边塞,高适,酬裴员外以诗代书,唐,少时方浩荡，遇物犹尘埃。脱略身外事，交游天下才。单车入燕赵，独立心悠哉。宁知戎马间，忽展平生怀。且欣清论高，岂顾夕阳颓。题诗碣石馆，纵酒燕王台。北望沙漠垂，漫天雪皑皑。临边无策略，览古空裴回。乐毅吾所怜，拔齐翻见猜。荆卿吾所悲，适秦不复回。然诺多死地，公忠成祸胎。与君从此辞，每恐流年催。如何俱老大，始复忘形骸。兄弟真二陆，声名连八裴。乙未将星变，贼臣候天灾。胡骑犯龙山，乘舆经马嵬。千官无倚着，万姓徒悲哀。诛吕鬼神动，安刘天地开。奔波走风尘，倏忽值云雷。拥旄出淮甸，入幕徵楚材。誓当剪鲸鲵，永以竭驽骀。小人胡不仁，谗我成死灰。赖得日月明，照耀无不该。留司洛阳宫，詹府唯蒿莱。是时扫氛祲，尚未歼渠魁。背河列长围，师老将亦乖。归军剧风火，散卒争椎埋。一夕瀍洛空，生灵悲曝腮。衣冠投草莽，予欲驰江淮。登顿宛叶下，栖遑襄邓隈。城池何萧条，邑屋更崩摧。纵横荆棘丛，但见瓦砾堆。行人无血色，战骨多青苔。遂除彭门守，因得朝玉阶。激昂仰鹓鹭，献替欣盐梅。驱传及远蕃，忧思郁难排。罢人纷争讼，赋税如山崖。所思在畿甸，曾是鲁宓侪。自从拜郎官，列宿焕天街。那能访遐僻，还复寄琼瑰。金玉本高价，埙篪终易谐。朗咏临清秋，凉风下庭槐。何意寇盗间，独称名义偕。辛酸陈侯诔，叹息季鹰杯。白日屡分手，青春不再来。卧看中散论，愁忆太常斋。酬赠徒为尔，长歌还自咍。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Reward Pei Yuanwai with poems on behalf of the scriptures,"When you are young, you are mighty, and when you meet things, you are like dust. Get away from foreign affairs and make friends with the world. Cycling into Yanzhao, independent mind leisurely. Ning Zhijun and horses, suddenly unfolded his life. And Xin Qing's theory is high, regardless of the setting sun. Inscriptions on the Jieshi Pavilion, and wine on the Yanwang Terrace. Looking north to the desert, the sky is covered with snow. There is no strategy on the edge, and you can see Gu Kong and Pei Hui. Le Yi is my pity, and I can see and guess. What I feel sad about Jing Qing is that Shi Qin will never return. However, Nuo Duo died, and public loyalty became a disaster. Since then, I have resigned from you, and I am reminded every time I am afraid of fleeting years. No matter how old you are, you will never forget your body. The brother is really Erlu, and his reputation is even better. Yi didn't change the stars, and the thieves waited for natural disasters. Hu Qi violated Longshan, and rode Yu Jing Mawei. Thousands of officials have nothing to rely on, and thousands of surnames are sad. Kill Lu's ghosts and spirits, and An Liu's heaven and earth will open. Running around in the wind and dust, suddenly worth cloud and thunder. Yongyan went out of Huaidian and entered the curtain to recruit Chu materials. I swear to cut the whale salamander, and I will never be exhausted. The villain Hu is ruthless, slandering me into ashes. The sun and the moon are so bright that there is nothing wrong with shining. Stay in Luoyang Palace, Zhan Mansion only Artemisia Lai. It's time to sweep the atmosphere, but not yet to wipe out Qukui. Carrying a long wall along the river, teachers and veterans are also obedient. Returning to the army, the drama is in turmoil, and the scattered soldiers fight for vertebral burial. Overnight, Luokong was empty, and the souls were sad. Clothes and crowns are thrown into the grass, and I want to gallop across the Yangtze River and Huaihe River. Under the leaves of Denton Wan, the habitat is not to mention Deng Kuma. How depressed the city is, and the houses are even more crumbling. There are thickets of thorns and thorns, but there are piles of rubble. Pedestrians are bloodless, and the bones of battle are covered with moss. So he got rid of Peng's guard, because he got the jade steps. Enthusiastically looking up to the heron, offering to replace Xin Yanmei. It's hard to get rid of anxiety and depression when it's passed on to the far away. Disputes and lawsuits are dismissed, and taxes are like cliffs. Susi was in Jidian, who was once Lu Miqiu. Since worshiping Langguan, he lived in Huantian Street. That can visit the secluded place, and send Qionggui back. The price of gold and jade is high, but Xunchi is easy to harmonize in the end. Lang Yong is facing Qingqiu, and the cool breeze is blowing in the courtyard. He Yi Kou Pirates, only called the name together. Bitter Chen Houyi, sigh Ji Ying Cup. Breaking up repeatedly during the day, youth no longer comes. Lying down and looking at the loose theory, worrying about Taichangzhai. The reward is for you, and the long song is also for you."
边塞,高适,酬裴秀才,唐,男儿贵得意，何必相知早。飘荡与物永，踌跎觉年老。长卿无产业，季子惭妻嫂。此事难重陈，未于众人道。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Pei Xiucai,"A man is very proud, why bother to know each other early. Floating with things forever, I feel old when I hesitate. Changqing has no property, and Jizi is ashamed of his wife and sister-in-law. It is difficult to repeat this matter, and it is not known to everyone."
边塞,高适,题李别驾壁,唐,去乡不远逢知己，握手相欢得如此。礼乐遥传鲁伯禽，宾客争过魏公子。酒筵暮散明月上，枥马长鸣春风起。一生称意能几人，今日从君问终始。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Li don't drive the wall,"Not far from the hometown to meet bosom friends, shake hands and enjoy each other like this. The rites and music spread far away to Lu Boqin, and the guests competed with Mr. Wei. The banquet is over at dusk and on the bright moon, the stable horses are singing and the spring breeze is blowing. How many people can be said to be capable in a lifetime, from the beginning to the end of today's question."
边塞,高适,题尉迟将军新庙,唐,周室既板荡，贼臣立婴儿。将军独激昂，誓欲酬恩私。孤城日无援，高节终可悲。家国共沦亡，精魂空在斯。沈沈积冤气，寂寂无人知。良牧怀深仁，与君建明祠。父子俱血食，轩车每逶迤。我来荐蘋蘩，感叹兴此词。晨光上阶闼，杀气翻旌旗。明明幽冥理，至诚信莫欺。唯夫二千石，多庆方自兹。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Inscribed General Yuchi's New Temple,"Zhou's house is sloppy, and the thieves set up babies. The general is passionate and vows to repay his kindness and selfishness. The lonely city is helpless every day, and the high festival is finally sad. The family and the country have all fallen, and the spirit is empty. The accumulation of grievances is silent and no one knows. Liang Mu cherishes deep benevolence and builds Ming Temple with Jun. Both father and son eat blood, and the car is winding every time. I'm here to recommend Ping Fan, and I sigh for this word. The morning light goes up to the gate, and the murderous spirit turns over the banner. It is clear about the dark truth, and the sincerity is not to be deceived. Only husband two thousand stones, Duoqing Fangzi hereby."
边塞,高适,燕歌行,唐,汉家烟尘在东北，汉将辞家破残贼。男儿本自重横行，天子非常赐颜色。摐金伐鼓下榆关，旌旆逶迤碣石间。校尉羽书飞瀚海，单于猎火照狼山。山川萧条极边土，胡骑凭陵杂风雨。战士军前半死生，美人帐下犹歌舞。大漠穷秋塞草腓，孤城落日斗兵稀。身当恩遇恒轻敌，力尽关山未解围。铁衣远戍辛勤久，玉箸应啼别离后。少妇城南欲断肠，征人蓟北空回首。边庭飘飖那可度，绝域苍茫更何有。杀气三时作阵云，寒声一夜传刁斗。相看白刃血纷纷，死节从来岂顾勋。君不见沙场征战苦，至今犹忆李将军。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Yan Ge Xing,"The smoke and dust of the Han family is in the northeast, and the Han will resign from the family to destroy the broken thieves. A man's self-esteem is rampant, and the emperor bestows color on him. Go down to Yuguan with the golden beating drum, and the Jingjing meanders between the stones. The captain's feather book flies to the vast sea, and Shan Yu hunts the fire to shine on the wolf mountain. The mountains and rivers are desolate and the extreme edge of the soil, Hu Qi relies on the mausoleum to mix wind and rain. The first half of the warrior army was dead and alive, and the beauties still sang and danced under the tent. The desert is poor in autumn, and the grass is filled with grass, and the lonely city is sparsely populated at sunset. When the body is kind, Yu Heng underestimates the enemy, and does his best to pass the siege without breaking through. Iron clothes have been stationed far away and worked hard for a long time, and jade chopsticks should cry after parting. The young woman wanted to break her heart in the south of the city, so the recruiter Ji Beikong looked back. The edge of the court can be saved, but the vastness of the absolute territory is even more so. The murderous aura is clouded at three o'clock, and the cold voice spreads Diao Dou all night. Looking at the white blades and blood pouring out, Gu Xun has never been dead. Don't you see the bitterness of the battle on the battlefield, and I still remember General Li to this day."
边塞,高适,赠别王十七管记,唐,故交吾未测，薄宦空年岁。晚节踪曩贤，雄词冠当世。堂中皆食客，门外多酒债。产业曾未言，衣裘与人敝。飘飖戎幕下，出入关山际。转战轻壮心，立谈有边计。云沙自回合，天海空迢递。星高汉将骄，月盛胡兵锐。沙深冷陉断，雪暗辽阳闭。亦谓扫欃枪，旋惊陷蜂虿。归旌告东捷，斗骑传西败。遥飞绝汉书，已筑长安第。画龙俱在叶，宠鹤先居卫。勿辞部曲勋，不藉将军势。相逢季冬月，伥望穷海裔。折剑留赠人，严装遂云迈。我行将悠?，及此还羁滞。曾非济代谋，且有临深诫。随波混清浊，与物同丑丽。眇忆青岩栖，宁忘褐衣拜。自言爱水石，本欲亲兰蕙。何意薄松筠，翻然重菅蒯。恒深取与分，孰慢平生契。款曲鸡黍期，酸辛别离袂。逢时愧名节，遇坎悲沦替。适赵非解纷，游燕往无说。浩歌方振荡，逸翮思凌励。倏若异鹏抟，吾当学蝉蜕。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Farewell to Wang Shiqiguan,"Therefore, I have not measured it, and the age of Bo Huankong. In the late festival, the sages are traced, and the heroic words are the best in the world. There are diners in the hall, and there are many wine debts outside the door. The industry has never been said, and the clothes and fur are the same as the people. Floating under the curtain of the army, entering and exiting the Guanshan Mountains. Turn to the battle with a light heart, and talk with a side plan. Clouds and sands turn around, and the sky, sea and sky pass by. The star is high and the Han will be arrogant, and the moon is prosperous and Hu Bingrui. The sand is deep and cold, and the snow is dark and Liaoyang is closed. It is also known as sweeping the gun, spinning and startling the bees. Return to Jing to tell Dongjie, and Douqi passes to West to lose. Flying far away from Han Shu, Chang'an has been built. Painting dragons is all in leaves, and pet cranes are the first to guard. Don't say goodbye to Quxun, don't borrow the power of the general. When we met Ji Dongyue, we looked forward to the poor sea descendants. The folded sword is left as a gift, and it is strictly pretended to be Yunmai. I'm about to linger, and this is still stagnant. He was once a schemer by Feiji, and he had a deep commandment. It is muddy and turbid with the waves, and it is as ugly and beautiful as things. Reminiscing about Qingyan habitat, rather forgetting to worship in brown clothes. He said that he loved Shuishi, and wanted to kiss Lan Hui. He Yi Bo Songyun, suddenly heavy Kan Kuai. Constantly take and divide, which one is slow for a lifetime contract. The song chicken millet period, sour and bitter. When it's time to be ashamed of your name, when you're in trouble, you're sad. When Zhao Fei resolved the dispute, You Yan had nothing to say. Haoge Fang oscillates, Yihe thinks Lingli. Like a different Peng Tuan, I should learn from cicadas to slough."
边塞,高适,赠别沈四逸人,唐,沈侯未可测，其况信浮沈。十载常独坐，几人知此心。乘舟蹈沧海，买剑投黄金。世务不足烦，有田西山岑。我来遇知己，遂得开清襟。何意阃阈间，沛然江海深。疾风扫秋树，濮上多鸣砧。耿耿尊酒前，联雁飞愁音。平生重离别，感激对孤琴。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Farewell to Shen Siyi,"Shen Hou is unpredictable, and his situation is believed to be ups and downs. I have often sat alone for ten years, how many people know this heart. Take a boat to cross the sea, buy a sword and throw gold. If the affairs of the world are not enough to bother you, there is Tian Xishan Cen. I came to meet my confidant, so I had to open my lapel. What do you mean between the thresholds, the rivers and seas are deep. The strong wind sweeps the autumn trees, and there are many anvils on the Pu. Before Geng Gengzun's wine, Lianyan flew sad. Parting again in my life, I am grateful to Guqin."
边塞,高适,赠别晋三处士,唐,有人家住清河源，渡河问我游梁园。手持道经注已毕，心知内篇口不言。卢门十年见秋草，此心惆怅谁能道。知己从来不易知，慕君为人与君好。别时九月桑叶疏，出门千里无行车。爱君且欲君先达，今上求贤早上书。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Farewell to Jin Sanji,"Someone lived in Qingheyuan, crossed the river and asked me to visit Liangyuan. Holding the Taoist scripture notes in hand, I know that the inner chapters will not be spoken. Lumen has seen autumn grass for ten years, who can tell me that he is melancholy. It's never easy to know a confidant, and Mu Jun is a good man and a good man. In September, the mulberry leaves were sparse, and there was no driving for thousands of miles. I love you and want you to be the first to achieve success. I am seeking talents today and writing in the morning."
边塞,高适,赠任华,唐,丈夫结交须结贫，贫者结交交始亲。世人不解结交者，唯重黄金不重人。黄金虽多有尽时，结交一成无竭期。君不见管仲与鲍叔，至今留名名不移。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Ren Hua,"Husbands must be poor when they make friends, and poor people only get married when they make friends. People in the world don't understand those who make friends, they only value gold and not people. Although there is an endless amount of gold, there is an endless period of friendship. Don't you see that Guan Zhong and Uncle Bao have left their names to this day."

I don't know the frontier, I am surprised by the guest clothes list. The sound of the cold spring in the stream is bitter, and the leaves are dry in the empty mountains. Mo Yan is closed to the extreme, and the clouds and snow are still long. Qingshankou, an ancient town, when the sun sets in the cold wind. There are no birds on the rocks, but horses on ice and snow. There should be no way to go out of the fortress, and it is time to return home. Dongshan is full of pine and osmanthus, and I return to Maoci. Denton drove the horse, and Qichi was ashamed of the sword. If you travel so far, it will be futile to have a small salary. The Jueban water flows down continuously, and the peaks and clouds are all high. You can become a white head, what's the matter with a green robe."
边塞,高适,闺情（为落殊蕃陈上相知人） 其四 闺情,唐,自处长信宫，每向孤灯泣。闺门镇不开，梦从何处入。相随万里泣胡风，疋偶将期一世终。早知中路生离别，悔不深怜沙碛中。不须推道委人猜，只是君心自不开。今夜闺门凭莫闭，孤魂拟向梦中来。祗今桃李正堪攀，所恨枝高引手难。原君垂下方便叶，袖卷将归看复看。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Boudoir love (for Luo Shufan Chen Shangxiang acquaintance) The fourth boudoir love,"From Director Xingong, weep to the lonely lamp every time. The boudoir gate is closed, where can the dream come from? Accompanied by thousands of miles of weeping Hu Feng, I will live forever. If I knew that the middle road was parting, I regret not deeply pity the sandy moraine. There is no need to push the truth and ask others to guess, it's just that the king can't open his mind. Tonight, the door of the boudoir must not be closed, and the lonely soul intends to come to the dream. Only now peaches and plums are just about to be climbed, but it's hard to get the hated branches high. Mr. Yuan hangs down the handy leaf, and the sleeve scroll will return and look again."
边塞,高适,九曲词三首,唐,许国从来彻庙堂，连年不为在疆场。将军天上封侯印，御史台中异姓王。万骑争歌杨柳春，千场对舞绣骐驎。到处尽逢欢洽事，相看总是太平人。铁骑横行铁岭头，西看逻逤取封侯。青海只今将饮马，黄河不用更防秋。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Three Songs of Nine Songs,"Xu Guo has always been in the temple, and he has not been on the battlefield for years. The general seals Hou Yin in the sky, and the censor Taizhong has a different surname Wang. Thousands of riders compete to sing willow spring, and thousands of dances dance to embroidered Qi. Everywhere is full of joy and business, and they are always peaceful people. The iron cavalry ran rampant at Tielingtou, looking west at Luolu and taking the title of Marquis. Qinghai will only drink horses today, and the Yellow River will not need to prevent autumn."
边塞,高适,玉真公主歌,唐,常言龙德本天仙，谁谓仙人每学仙。更道玄元指李日，多于王母种桃年。仙宫仙府有真仙，天宝天仙秘莫传。为问轩皇三百岁，何如大道一千年。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Princess Yuzhen Song,"As the saying goes, Longde is originally an immortal, and whoever calls an immortal learns from an immortal. It is more said that Xuanyuan refers to Li Ri, which is more than the year when the Queen Mother grows peaches. There are real immortals in the Immortal Palace and Immortal Mansion, but the secrets of Tianbao and Tianxian cannot be passed on. In order to ask Xuanhuang three hundred years old, how is it like a thousand years of Taoism."
边塞,高适,别董大二首,唐,十里黄云白日曛，北风吹雁雪纷纷。莫愁前路无知己，天下谁人不识君。六翮飘飖私自怜，一离京洛十馀年。丈夫贫贱应未足，今日相逢无酒钱。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Farewell to Dong Da Er,"Ten miles of yellow clouds and white sun, the north wind blows geese and snow. Don't worry about having no confidant in the future, no one in the world knows the king. Liu Hepiaoxi pityed himself privately, and one left Jingluo for more than ten years. The husband should be rich and humble, and we meet today without money for wine."
边塞,高适,登百丈峰二首,唐,朝登百丈峰，遥望燕支道。汉垒青冥间，胡天白如扫。忆昔霍将军，连年此征讨。匈奴终不灭，寒山徒草草。唯见鸿雁飞，令人伤怀抱。晋武轻后事，惠皇终已昏。豺狼塞瀍洛，胡羯争乾坤。四海如鼎沸，五原徒自尊。而今白庭路，犹对青阳门。朝市不足问，君臣随草根。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Climbing Baizhang Peak Two Poems,"Climb to Baizhang Peak and look at Yanzhi Road in the distance. Between Han Lei and Qing Ming, Hu Tian is as white as sweeping. Reminiscing about General Huo's past, he has fought this campaign year after year. The Xiongnu will never die, and the cold mountains will be nothing but grass. Seeing swan geese flying makes one feel sad. Jin Wu took care of the funeral, and Huihuang finally fainted. The jackal is in the middle of the Luo, and the tiger is fighting for the universe. The four seas are like a turmoil, and the Wuyuan are self-respecting. Now Baiting Road is still facing Qingyang Gate. There are not enough questions in the morning market, and the monarchs and ministers follow the grassroots."
边塞,高适,宓公琴台诗三首,唐,宓子昔为政，鸣琴登此台。琴和人亦闲，千载称其才。临眺忽悽怆，人琴安在哉？悠悠此天壤，唯有颂声来。邦伯感遗事，慨然建琴堂。乃知静者心，千载犹相望。入室想其人，出门何茫茫。唯见白云合，东临邹鲁乡。皤皤邑中老，自誇邑中理。何必升君堂，然后知君美。开门无犬吠，早卧常晏起。昔人不忍欺，今我还复尔。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Mi Gong's Three Poems on Qintai,"Mi Zi used to be a government official, playing the qin on this stage. Qin and people are also idle, and they have been called talents for thousands of years. When you look at the sight and feel sad, where is the human piano? In this world, only the sound of praise comes. Feeling the legacy, Bangbo generously built the piano hall. It is the heart of those who know tranquility, and they will still look at each other for thousands of years. When you enter the room, you miss the person, but when you go out, you are boundless. I can only see Baiyunhe, facing Zoulu Township in the east. The old man in Bo Bo, boasting of the principles in the city. Why bother to ascend to the emperor's hall, and then know the beauty of the emperor. Open the door without a dog barking, I lie down early and get up often. People in the past couldn't bear to be bullied, but now I will return to you."
边塞,高适,宋中十首,唐,梁王昔全盛，宾客复多才。悠悠一千年，陈迹唯高台。寂寞向秋草，悲风千里来。朝临孟诸上，忽见芒砀间。赤帝终已矣，白云长不还。时清更何有，禾黍遍空山。景公德何广，临变莫能欺。三请皆不忍，妖星终自移。君心本如此，天道岂无知。梁苑白日暮，梁山秋草时。君王不可见，脩竹令人悲。九月桑叶尽，寒风鸣树枝。登高临旧国，怀古对穷秋。落日鸿雁度，寒城砧杵愁。昔贤不复有，行矣莫淹留。出门望终古，独立悲且歌。忆昔鲁仲尼，悽悽此经过。众人不可向，伐树将如何。逍遥漆园吏，冥没不知年。世事浮云外，闲居大道边。古来同一马，今我亦忘筌。五霸递征伐，宋人无战功。解围幸奇说，易子伤吾衷。唯见卢门外，萧条多转蓬。常爱宓子贱，鸣琴能自亲。邑中静无事，岂不由其身。何意千年后，寂寞无此人。阏伯去已久，高丘临道傍。人皆有兄弟，尔独为参商。终古犹如此，而今安可量。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Ten Poems in Song Dynasty,"In the past, Liang Wang was in full prosperity, and the guests were more talented. For a thousand years, there is only a high platform. Lonely to the autumn grass, sad wind thousands of miles. When I approached Meng Zhushang, I suddenly saw the mangdang room. The Red Emperor is dead, and the white cloud will never return. What is more in the Qing Dynasty, the millet is all over the empty mountains. He Guang, Jing Gongde, can't be deceived in the face of change. If you can't bear the three requests, the demon star will eventually move by itself. The king's heart is like this, the way of heaven is ignorant. The sun is setting in Liangyuan, and the autumn grass is in Liangshan. The king is invisible, and the bamboo is sad. In September, the mulberry leaves are exhausted, and the cold wind blows the branches. Climb to the old country, nostalgia for the past and the poor autumn. The swan geese spend the sunset, and the anvil and pestle in the cold city are sad. The old sages no longer exist, and don't drown them when they are done. Going out to look at the past, independent sad and singing. Recalling Lu Zhongni in the past, it was desolate. What will happen if the trees are cut down. The official of Xiaoyao Lacquer Garden, I don’t know the year. The world is beyond the clouds, and I live by the side of the road. The same horse in ancient times, but now I also forget the trap. The five tyrants conquered each other, and the people of Song Dynasty had no military exploits. Jiewei Xingqi said, Yi Zi hurts my heart. Only outside the Lumen, the depression turns around. I often love Mi Zijian, and I can kiss myself by playing the piano. There is nothing wrong in the city, so it's not up to you. After thousands of years, there is no such person in loneliness. Uncle Yan has been gone for a long time, and Gao Qiu is near the road. Everyone has brothers, and you are alone in business. It has always been like this in ancient times, but now it can be measured."
边塞,高适,自淇涉黄河途中作十三首,唐,川上常极目，世情今已闲。去帆带落日，征路随长山。亲友若云霄，可望不可攀。于兹任所惬，浩荡风波间。清晨泛中流，羽族满汀渚。黄鹄何处来，昂藏寡俦侣。飞鸣无人见，饮啄岂得所。云汉尔固知，胡为不轻举。野人头尽白，与我忽相访。手持青竹竿，日暮淇水上。虽老美容色，虽贫亦闲放。钓鱼三十年，中心无所向。南登滑台上，却望河淇间。竹树夹流水，孤城对远山。念兹川路阔，羡尔沙鸥闲。长想别离处，犹无音信还。东入黄河水，茫茫汎纡直。北望太行山，峨峨半天色。山河相映带，深浅未可测。自昔有贤才，相逢不相识。秋日登滑台，台高秋已暮。独行既未惬，怀土怅无趣。晋宋何萧条，羌胡散驰骛。当时无战略，此地即边戍。兵革徒自勤，山河孰云固。乘闲喜临眺，感物伤游寓。惆怅落日前，飘飖远帆处。北风吹万里，南雁不知数。归意方浩然，云沙更回互。乱流自兹远，倚楫时一望。遥见楚汉城，崔嵬高山上。天道昔未测，人心无所向。屠钓称侯王，龙蛇争霸王。缅怀多杀戮，顾此生惨怆。圣代休甲兵，吾其得闲放。兹川方悠邈，云沙无前后。古堰对河壖，长林出淇口。独行非吾意，东向日已久。忧来谁得知，且酌尊中酒。朝从北岸来，泊船南河浒。试共野人言，深觉农夫苦。去秋虽薄熟，今夏犹未雨。耕耘日勤劳，租税兼舄卤。园蔬空寥落，产业不足数。尚有献芹心，无因见明主。茫茫浊河注，怀古临河滨。禹功本豁达，汉迹方因循。坎德昔滂沱，冯夷胡不仁。激潏陵堤防，东郡多悲辛。天子忽惊悼，从官皆负薪。畚筑岂无谋，祈祷如有神。宣房今安在，高岸空嶙峋。我行倦风湍，辍棹将问津。空传歌瓠子，感慨独愁人。孟夏桑叶肥，秾阴夹长津。蚕农有时节，田野无闲人。临水狎渔樵，望山怀隐沦。谁能去京洛，憔悴对风尘。朝景入平川，川长复垂柳。遥看魏公墓，突兀前山后。忆昔大业时，群雄角奔走。伊人何电迈，独立风尘首。传檄举敖仓，拥兵屯洛口。连营一百万，六合如可有。方项终比肩，乱隋将假手。力争固难恃，骄战曷能久。若使学萧曹，功名当不朽。皤皤河滨叟，相遇似有耻。辍榜聊问之，荅言尽终始。一生虽贫贱，九十年未死。且喜对儿孙，弥惭远城市。结庐黄河曲，垂钓长河里。漫漫望云沙，萧条听风水。所思强饭食，永愿在乡里。万事吾不知，其心只如此。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Composing thirteen poems on the way from Qi to the Yellow River,"Kawakami is often extremely eye-catching, and the world is now idle. Go to the sail to take the sunset, and follow the long mountain on the road. Relatives and friends are like clouds, which can be expected but unattainable. Yu Zi Ren is comfortable, amidst the mighty turmoil. In the early morning, the pan-middle stream, the feather clan is full of Tingzhu. Where did Huang Hu come from? Angzang and his wife. No one sees Feiming, how can you get what you drink and peck. Yun Haner knew that Hu did not act lightly. The savage's head is completely white, and he suddenly visits me. Holding a green bamboo pole, Rimuqi is on the water. Although old and beautiful, although poor, he is also idle. After 30 years of fishing, the center has no direction. Nan boarded the skating platform, but looked at the river and Qi. Bamboo trees are sandwiched by flowing water, and the isolated city faces the distant mountains. Nianzichuan has a wide road, and Xianer Shagull is free. I have long wanted to leave, but there is still no news. The water of the Yellow River flows into the east, and it is vast and straight. Looking north at Taihang Mountain, E'e is half-sky. The mountains and rivers contrast with each other, and the depth is unpredictable. Since the past, there have been talented people who met each other but did not know each other. Going up the skating platform in autumn, the height of the platform is late in autumn. Walking alone is not pleasant, and cherishing the soil is boring. He was depressed in the Jin and Song Dynasties, and the Qiang and Hu were scattered. There was no strategy at that time, and this place was the frontier garrison. Soldiers and revolutionists are self-diligent, and the mountains and rivers are solid. Take leisure time to enjoy the view, feel the hurt of things and travel. Before the melancholy sunset, I floated far away from the sails. The north wind blows thousands of miles, but the number of southern geese is unknown. Returning to Fang Haoran, Yunsha returned to each other. The turbulent flow is far away, and you can look at it while leaning on the oar. I can see the city of Chu Han in the distance, on the high mountain of Cui Wei. The way of heaven is unpredictable, and people's hearts have no direction. Tu Diao is called the Marquis King, and dragons and snakes fight for the overlord. Reminiscing about the many killings, Gu this life is miserable. Sundae's armored soldiers, I have to relax. The river is long and long, and there is no front and back in the clouds and sand. The ancient weir faces the river, and the long forest exits the mouth of Qi. It is not my intention to walk alone, and the east has been facing the sun for a long time. Who knows when you are worried, and drink wine with respect. North Korea came from the north bank, mooring boats in Nanhehu. Trying to share the words of the savages, I deeply feel that the farmers are suffering. Although it was thinly ripe last autumn, it still hasn't rained this summer. Cultivation day is hardworking, rent and tax are concurrently paid for. There are few vegetables in the garden, and there are not enough industries. There is still the heart to offer tribute, but there is no reason to see the Lord. The vast turbid river pours, nostalgia for the past and the riverside. Yu Gong was originally open-minded, and Han traces were followed. Cande was tormented in the past, and Feng Yihu was not benevolent. The embankment of Jilingling is very sad. The emperor suddenly mourned, and all officials paid their salaries. Is there no plan in building a dustpan, and praying is like a god. Xuanfang is here today, and the high shore is empty. I'm tired of the wind and turbulence, and I'll stop to ask for it. Passing the song gourd in the air, feeling lonely and sad. Meng Xia's mulberry leaves are fat, and Changjin is clipped by Yin Yin. Silkworm farmers have seasons, and there are no idlers in the fields. Facing fishermen and woodcutters by the water, gazing at the mountains and embracing hidden dangers. Who can go to Jingluo, haggard to Fengchen. Chaojing enters Pingchuan, and the river grows back to weeping willows. Looking at the Wei cemetery from a distance, it is abrupt in front of the mountain and behind the mountain. When recalling the great cause of the past, the heroes are running around. He Dianmai, a Iraqi, is an independent leader. It is said that Ao Cang will be raised, and soldiers will be stationed at Luokou. With a company of one million, if there is a heaven and earth. Fang Xiang finally stood shoulder to shoulder, and the generals of the Sui Dynasty made fake hands. Striving hard is hard to rely on, but fighting arrogantly can last long. If you learn from Xiao Cao, your fame will be immortal. It seems shameful to meet an old man by the riverside. Drop off the list to chat and ask, and the words are exhausted. Although he was poor and humble all his life, he did not die in ninety years. And I am happy with my children and grandchildren, and I am ashamed of being far away from the city. Jielu Yellow River bends, fishing in the long river. Look at the clouds and sand for a long time, and listen to Fengshui when you are depressed. Susiqiang food, always willing to be in the village. I don't know everything, that's all I have in mind."
边塞,高适,东平路作三首,唐,南图适不就，东走岂吾心。索索凉风动，行行秋水深。蝉鸣木叶落，兹夕更愁霖。明时好画策，动欲干王公。今日无成事，依依亲老农。扁舟向何处？吾爱汶阳中。清旷凉夜月，裴回孤客舟。渺然风波上，独爱前山秋。秋至复摇落，空令行者愁。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Dongping Road Composing Three Poems,"If the southern map is suitable, it is not my heart to go east. The cool wind moves, and the water is deep in autumn. The cicadas sing and the leaves fall, making me more worried about the rain in the evening. Tomorrow is a good strategy, and I want to be a prince. Nothing happened today, Yiyi kisses the old farmer. Where is the boat heading? I love Wenyangzhong. In the clear and cool night and the moon, Pei returned to the lonely passenger boat. However, on the turmoil, I only love Qianshanqiu. The autumn solstice shakes and falls again, and the sky makes the traveler worry."
边塞,高适,苦雪四首,唐,二月犹北风，天阴雪冥冥。寥落一室中，怅然惭百龄。苦愁正如此，门柳复青青。惠连发清兴，袁安念高卧。余故非斯人，为性兼懒惰。赖兹尊中酒，终日聊自过。濛濛洒平陆，淅沥至幽居。且喜润群物，焉能悲斗储。故交久不见，鸟雀投吾庐。孰云久闲旷，本自保知寡。穷巷独无成，春条秪盈把。安能羡鹏举，且欲歌牛下。乃知古时人，亦有如我者。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Four Poems of Bitter Snow,"In February, there is still a north wind, and the sky is cloudy and snowy. In a deserted room, I feel ashamed and ashamed for a hundred years. Sadness is just like this, and the willows are green again. Hui Lianfa Qingxing, Yuan Annian lying high. I am a Festian, who is sexual and lazy. Reiz respects wine and chats about himself all day long. Sprinkle the flat land, patter to the secluded residence. And like to nourish the group, how can you be sad. I haven't seen you for a long time, and the birds have thrown themselves into my hut. It is said that if you are idle for a long time, you should protect yourself and know the few. The poor alleys have nothing to do alone, and the spring sticks are full. An Neng is envious of Pengju, and wants to sing a song. I know that people in ancient times were like me."
边塞,高适,杂曲歌辞 行路难二首,唐,君不见富家翁，旧时贫贱谁比数。一朝金多结豪贵，万事胜人健如虎。子孙成行满眼前，妻能管弦妾能舞。自矜一身忽如此，却笑傍人独愁苦。东邻少年安所如，席门穷巷出无车。有才不肯学干谒，何用年年空读书。长安少年不少钱，能骑骏马鸣金鞭。五侯相逢大道边，美人弦管争留连。黄金如斗不敢惜，片言如山莫弃捐。安知憔悴读书者，暮宿虚台私自怜。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Miscellaneous Songs and Songs,"Don't you see a rich man, in the old days who was poor and humble. Once the gold is rich and the wealth is rich, all things are victorious, and the people are as healthy as a tiger. The children and grandchildren are full of lines, and the wife can orchestrate and the concubine can dance. All of a sudden, he is so self-confident, but laughs at others and suffers alone. An Suoru is a young man next door to the east, and there is no car in Ximen Qiong Lane. If you are talented and refuse to learn, why do you spend time reading every year? The young man in Chang'an has a lot of money, and he can ride a horse and win the golden whip. The five princes meet on the side of the avenue, and the beauties compete to linger. Gold is like a fight without daring to cherish, a word is like a mountain, don't give up. An Zhi is haggard and haggard, a scholar who stays on the empty platform at night and feels sorry for himself."
边塞,高适,杂曲歌辞 蓟门行五首,唐,茫茫长城外，日没更烟尘。胡骑虽凭陵，汉兵不顾身。古树满空塞，黄云愁杀人。汉家能用武，开拓穷异域。戍卒厌糠覈，降胡饱衣食。开亭试一望，吾欲涕沾臆。蓟门逢古老，独立思氛氲。一身既零丁，头鬓白纷纷。勋庸今已矣，不识霍将军。边城十一月，雨雪乱霏霏。元戎号令严，人马亦轻肥。羌胡无尽日，征战几时归。幽州多骑射，结发重横行。一朝事将军，出入有声名。纷纷猎秋草，相向角弓鸣。,Frontier fortress,high fitness,Five Poems of Miscellaneous Songs and Lyrics of Jimen Xing,"Outside the vast Great Wall, there is no more smoke and dust. Although Hu Qi relied on the mausoleum, the Han soldiers did not care about themselves. The ancient trees filled the air, and Huang Yunchou killed people. The Han family can use martial arts to open up poor and exotic lands. The soldiers in the garrison are disgusted with chaff and seeds, and they are full of food and clothing. Open the pavilion and try it out, I want to burst into tears. Jimen is ancient, independent thinking atmosphere. She was all alone, and her hair was white. Xun Yong is dead now, and he doesn't know General Huo. In November in the border town, it was raining and snowing. Yuan Rong has strict orders, and the men and horses are light and fat. The Qiang and Hu have endless days, when will they return from the battle. Youzhou rides and shoots a lot, and the knots and hair are rampant. Once he served as a general in the dynasty, he was famous when he went in and out. They hunt autumn grass one after another, and bow their horns to each other."

Daozhou fell into a dream again, and Jiange wrote an inscription again. Spring grass with green ribbons and red flags among sunny flowers. Mountain warblers send wine at morning, Jiang Yue offers poems at night. Xu Guofen worries about the day, and honors his relatives to support his time. The common people have been looking forward to it for a long time, and it should not be too late to come and go."
边塞,岑参,送庐郎中除杭州赴任,唐,罢起郎官草，初分刺史符。海云迎过楚，江月引归吴。城底涛声震，楼端蜃气孤。千家窥驿舫，五马饮春湖。柳色供诗用，莺声送酒须。知君望乡处，枉道上姑苏。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Send Lu doctor to go to work in addition to Hangzhou,"Let go of Lang Guancao, and first divide the assassin's talisman. Hai Yun greeted Chu, and Jiang Yue led back to Wu. The sound of the waves at the bottom of the city is shaking, and the mirage at the end of the building is lonely. Thousands of families peek at the post boat, and five horses drink in the spring lake. The willow color is for poetry, and the voice of the warbler is for wine whiskers. Knowing the king's hometown, he went to Gusu in vain."
边塞,岑参,送李翥游江外,唐,相识应十载，见君只一官。家贫禄尚薄，霜降衣仍单。惆怅秋草死，萧条芳岁阑。且寻沧洲路，遥指吴云端。匹马关塞远，孤舟江海宽。夜眠楚烟湿，晓饭湖山寒。砧净红鲙落，袖香朱橘团。帆前见禹庙，枕底闻严滩。便获赏心趣，岂歌行路难。青门须醉别，少为解征鞍。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Sending Li Zhu on a tour outside the river,"We have known each other for ten years, and only one official sees you. The family is poor and the salary is still thin, and Shuangjiang's clothes are still alone. The melancholy autumn grass dies, and the desolate Fang is old. Let's look for Cangzhou Road and point to Wu Yun in the distance. A horse is far away from the gate, and a lonely boat is wide across the river. Sleeping at night, the smoke is damp in Chu, and the lake and mountains are cold at dawn. The anvil is clean and the red carp is falling, and the sleeves are fragrant and vermilion orange. See Yu Temple before the sail, and hear Yantan under the pillow. Then you will be rewarded, and it will be difficult to sing and travel. Qingmen must be drunk and farewell, and less is the saddle for Jie Zheng."
边塞,岑参,送郭仆射节制剑南,唐,铁马擐红缨，幡旗出禁城。明王亲授钺，丞相欲专征。玉馔天厨送，金杯御酒倾。剑门乘崄过，阁道踏空行。山鸟惊吹笛，江猿看洗兵。晓云随去阵，夜月逐行营。南仲今时往，西戎计日平。将心感知己，万里寄悬旌。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Send Guo Pu to control Jiannan,"The iron horse pulls the red tassels, and the flags leave the Forbidden City. The king of Ming personally conferred the axe, and the prime minister wanted to conscript it. Jade delicacies are sent by the heavenly chef, and golden cups are poured into the imperial wine. The sword gate passed by, and the pavilion road stepped on the empty line. The mountain bird is frightened and plays the flute, and the river ape is watching the washing of soldiers. Xiaoyun went to battle with him, and Yeyue camped one by one. Nanzhong is going now, and Xirong is counting Riping. Perceive yourself with your heart, and send hanging banners thousands of miles away."
边塞,岑参,送陶铣弃举荆南觐省,唐,明时不爱璧，浪迹东南游。何必世人识，知君轻五侯。采兰度汉水，问绢过荆州。异国有归兴，去乡无客愁。天寒楚塞雨，月净襄阳秋。坐见吾道远，令人看白头。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Sending pottery to abandon Jingnan province,"In the Ming Dynasty, he didn't love bi, and wandered southeast. Why should the world know, knowing the king and despising the five princes. Cailan crosses the Han River, and asks the silk to pass through Jingzhou.

Sitting and seeing me far away makes people look pale."

On the way back, the Qin trees are destroyed, and the river flows to the village. Watching the horse head go, the ears are full of cicadas. Xianfu is not sold today, and reading is common in autumn. It should pass Boyi Temple, which is the city tower of Shangguan. The upstairs can remember each other, and the southwest refers to Yongzhou."
边塞,岑参,送薛播擢第归河东,唐,归去新战胜，盛名人共闻。乡连渭川树，家近条山云。夫子能好学，圣朝全用文。弟兄负世誉，词赋超人群。雨气醒别酒，城阴低暮曛。遥知出关后，更有一终军。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Send Xue Bozhuo back to Hedong,"Returning to the new victory, the fame is well known to all. The township is connected to the Weichuan tree, and the home is close to the mountain cloud. The master is eager to learn, and the holy pilgrimage is all written. The brothers have a world reputation, and their poems are beyond the crowd. The rain sobers up the wine, and the city is dark and dark. After Yao Zhi left the customs, there was a final army."
边塞,岑参,陪群公龙冈寺泛舟,唐,汉水天一色，寺楼波底看。钟鸣长空夕，月出孤舟寒。映酒见山火，隔帘闻夜滩。紫鳞掣芳饵，红烛然金盘。良友兴正惬，胜游情未阑。此中堪倒载，须尽主人欢。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Go boating with Qungong Longgang Temple,"The water of Han Dynasty is the same color as the sky, and the bottom of the temple tower is seen. The bell rings in the sky, the moon rises and the boat is cold. You can see the fire in the wine, and you can smell the night beach through the curtain. The purple scales hold the fragrant bait, and the red candle is like a golden plate. Good friends are happy and happy, and the love is not over. This can be reversed, and the owner must be happy."
边塞,岑参,骊姬墓下作,唐,骊姬北原上，闭骨已千秋。浍水日东注，恶名终不流。献公恣耽惑，视子如仇雠。此事成蔓草，我来逢古丘。蛾眉山月苦，蝉鬓野云愁。欲吊二公子，横汾无轻舟。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Under Li Ji's Tomb,"On Li Ji's northern plains, her bones have been closed for thousands of years. As the water flows eastward, the notoriety will never flow. Xian Gong indulges in confusion, and regards his son as a hater. This matter becomes weeds, I come to Guqiu. Crescent moon is bitter, and cicada temples are clouded with sorrow. If you want to hang the second son, there is no light boat in Hengfen."
边塞,岑参,虢州送郑兴宗弟归扶风别庐,唐,佐郡已三载，岂能长后时。出关少亲友，赖汝常相随。今旦忽言别，怆然俱泪垂。平生沧洲意，独有青山知。州县不敢说，云霄谁敢期。因怀东溪老，最忆南峰缁。为我多种药，还山应未迟。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Guozhou sent Zheng Xingzong's brother back to Fufeng Bielu,"Zuo County has been in for three years, how can it last for a long time. Leaving customs with few relatives and friends, Lai Ru often accompanied me. Today, I suddenly say goodbye, and weep with sorrow. The meaning of Cangzhou in my whole life is unique to Qingshan. States and counties dare not say, who dares to expect in the sky. Because of Huai Dongxi's old age, I remember Nanfeng the most. It's not too late to return to the mountain with a variety of medicines for me."
边塞,岑参,入剑门作寄杜杨二郎中时二公并为杜元帅判官,唐,不知造化初，此山谁开坼。双崖倚天立，万仞从地劈。云飞不到顶，鸟去难过壁。速驾畏岩倾，单行愁路窄。平明地仍黑，停午日暂赤。凛凛三伏寒，巉巉五丁迹。与时忽开闭，作固或顺逆。磅礴跨岷峨，巍蟠限蛮貊。星当觜参分，地处西南僻。陡觉烟景殊，杳将华夏隔。刘氏昔颠覆，公孙曾败绩。始知德不脩，恃此险何益。相公总师旅，远近罢金革。杜母来何迟，蜀人应更惜。暂回丹青虑，少用开济策。二友华省郎，俱为幕中客。良筹佐戎律，精理皆硕画。高文出诗骚，奥学穷讨赜。圣朝无外户，寰宇被德泽。四海今一家，徒然剑门石。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,"Entering Jianmen as a post to Du Yang Erlang, when he was a middle-aged man, he was also the judge of Marshal Du","don't know who opened this mountain at the beginning of good fortune. The double cliffs stand against the sky, and Wan Ren is split from the ground. Clouds can't fly to the top, and birds can't pass the wall. Driving fast is afraid of rocks tilting, one-way worrying about narrow roads. Pingming is still dark, and the sun is temporarily red at noon. It's cold in the three periods of cold, and there are five traces. It opens and closes suddenly with the time, and acts as a solid or forward and reverse. Majestic across Min'e, majestic and limited. Xingdangxi is divided into ginseng and is located in the remote southwest. Doujue smoke scene is different, Yao will separate China. The Liu family was overthrown in the past, and Gongsun was defeated. Only then did I know that virtue is not cultivated, so what is the benefit of relying on this danger. Xianggong is the chief teacher of the brigade, and the golden leather is far and near. The people of Shu should cherish Du's mother even more. Go back to Danqing for a while, and use less relief. Two friends, Hua Shenglang, are both behind the curtain. A good plan assists the military law, and both the essence and the theory are masterful paintings. Gao Wen publishes poems and shows, and Austrian learning is poor. There is no outside house in the holy pilgrimage, and the world is surrounded by Deze. The world is now a family, but the sword door is in vain."
边塞,岑参,入蒲关先寄秦中故人,唐,秦山数点似青黛，渭上一条如白练。京师故人不可见，寄将两眼看飞燕。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,"When entering Puguan, first send to the old friend in Qin Dynasty","The number of Qinshan Mountains is like Qingdai, and the stretch of Wei is like Bailian. The old man in the capital cannot be seen, so he sent his eyes to Feiyan."

边塞,岑参,上嘉州青衣山中峰题惠净上人幽居寄兵部杨郎中,唐,青衣谁开凿，独在水中央。浮舟一跻攀，侧径缘穹苍。绝顶诣老僧，豁然登上方。诸岭一何小，三江奔茫茫。兰若向西开，峨眉正相当。猿鸟乐钟磬，松萝泛天香。江云入袈裟，山月吐绳床。早知清净理，久乃机心忘。尚以名宦拘，聿来夷獠乡。吾友不可见，郁为尚书郎。早岁爱丹经，留心向青囊。渺渺云智远，幽幽海怀长。胜赏欲与俱，引领遥相望。为政愧无术，分忧幸时康。君子满天朝，老夫忆沧浪。况值庐山远，抽簪归法王。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,"On the peak of Tsingyi Mountain in Shangjiazhou, Master Huijing lived in seclusion and sent to Yang Langzhong of the Ministry of War","Whoever digs in Tsing Yi is alone in the middle of the water. As soon as the floating boat climbs, the side diameter borders the sky. The extremely accomplished old monk suddenly climbed to the top. The mountains are so small, and the three rivers are boundless. If Lan Ruo drives west, Emei is exactly the same. The ape and bird music bells and chimes, and the pine tree is full of heavenly fragrance. Jiang Yun puts into cassock, Shanyue stretches out the rope bed. If you know the principle of purity early, you will forget it for a long time. Still under the name of eunuch, Yu came to Yi Liao Township. My friend is invisible, Yu is Shang Shulang. In the early years, I loved the Danjing, and paid attention to the green pouch. The misty cloud is far away, and the faint sea is long. The desire to win and reward is all there is to lead and look at each other from afar. I am ashamed of being incompetent for politics, and I am happy when I share my worries. Gentlemen are all over the sky, and the old man recalls the waves. The situation is far away from Lushan Mountain, and the hairpin belongs to the King of Dharma."
边塞,岑参,下外江舟怀终南旧居,唐,杉冷晓猿悲，楚客心欲绝。孤舟巴山雨，万里阴台月。水宿已淹时，芦花白如雪。颜容老难赪，把镜悲鬓发。早年好金丹，方士传口诀。敝庐终南下，久与真侣别。道书谁更开，药灶烟遂灭。顷来压尘网，安得有仙骨。岩壑归去来，公卿是何物。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Xiawaijiangzhou Huaizhong South Former Residence,"Shan Leng Xiaoyuan was sad, and Chu Ke was heartbroken. The lonely boat is raining in Bashan, and the moon is overcast for thousands of miles. When the water house is flooded, the reed flowers are as white as snow. His face is old and difficult to fade, and his hair on the temples is sad. In the early years, he was a good golden pill, and alchemists passed on formulas. My hut finally went south, and I said goodbye to my real couple for a long time. Whoever opened the Daoist book more, the smoke from the medicinal stove would be extinguished. After a while to press the dust net, there are fairy bones in An De. What is the Gongqing when the rocks and valleys go back."
边塞,岑参,与独孤渐道别长句兼呈严八侍御,唐,轮台客舍春草满，颍阳归客肠堪断。穷荒绝漠鸟不飞，万碛千山梦犹懒。怜君白面一书生，读书千卷未成名。五侯贵门脚不到，数亩山田身自耕。兴来浪迹无远近，及至辞家忆乡信。无事垂鞭信马头，西南几欲穷天尽。奉使三年独未归，边头词客旧来稀。借问君来得几日，到家不觉换春衣。高斋清昼卷帷幕，纱帽接䍦慵不着。中酒朝眠日色高，弹棋夜半灯花落。冰片高堆金错盘，满堂凛凛五月寒。桂林蒲萄新吐蔓，武城㓨蜜未可餐。军中置酒夜挝鼓，锦筵红烛月未午。花门将军善胡歌，叶河蕃王能汉语。知尔园林压渭滨，夫人堂上泣罗裙。鱼龙川北盘溪雨，鸟鼠山西洮水云。台中严公于我厚，别后新诗满人口。自怜弃置天西头，因君为问相思否。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Saying Goodbye to Dugu Jian with a Long Sentence and Strict Eight Attendants,"The guest house in Luntai is full of spring grass, and the returning guests of Yingyang are heartbroken. Birds don't fly in the poor desert, and the dream of thousands of moraine and thousands of mountains is still lazy. Lianjun is a white-faced scholar who has not become famous after reading thousands of volumes. The five princes and nobles are within reach, and several acres of mountain fields are cultivated by themselves. Xinglai wanders without distance, until he resigns from home and recalls his hometown. If there is nothing to do, the whip will trust the horse's head, and the southwest is almost exhausted. The envoy has not returned alone for three years, and the poets on the sidelines are old and rare. May I ask how long you have been here, and you don't feel like changing your spring clothes when you get home. Gao Zhai rolled up the curtain in the clear day, and the gauze hat couldn't be languidly attached. In the middle of the night, the sun is high when you sleep in wine, and the lights fall in the middle of the night when you play chess. The ice flakes are piled high and gold is mixed on the plate, and the house is full of coldness in May. The grapes in Guilin are newly sprouting vines, and the honey in Wucheng is not enough to eat. Wine is placed in the army at night and drums are set, and the golden feast and red candles are not in the middle of the month. General Huamen is good at Huge, and King Yehefan can speak Chinese. The garden of Zhier presses Weibin, and the wife's hall weeps in Luoqun. There is rain in the pan stream in the north of Yulongchuan, and the cloud in Taoshui in the west of Bird Mouse Mountain. Taichung Lord Yan is kind to me, and the new poems after the farewell are full of people. Self-pity and abandon Tianxitou, because the king asks if lovesickness."
边塞,岑参,与高适薛据慈恩寺浮图,唐,塔势如涌出，孤高耸天宫。登临出世界，磴道盘虚空。突兀压神州，峥嵘如鬼工。四角碍白日，七层摩苍穹。下窥指高鸟，俯听闻惊风。连山若波涛，奔凑似朝东。青槐夹驰道，宫馆何玲珑。秋色从西来，苍然满关中。五陵北原上，万古青濛濛。净理了可悟，胜因夙所宗。誓将挂冠去，觉道资无穷。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,With Gao Shixue according to the pagoda of Ci'en Temple,"The tower is like a gushing out, and the lonely towering sky palace. Ascending out of the world, the road is empty. It suddenly overwhelms Shenzhou, and it is as tall as a ghost's work. The four corners obstruct the day, and the seven layers touch the sky. Peeping down refers to the tall bird, and listening to the startling wind. The mountains are like waves, rushing to the east. The green pagoda tree runs along the road, and the palace hall is so exquisite. Autumn colors come from the west, and the green is full of Guanzhong. On the northern plains of the Wuling Tombs, there is eternal greenness. Purification can be comprehended, and it is superior to the ancient ancestors. I swear that I will hang the crown, and feel that the way is infinite."
边塞,岑参,与鄠县群官泛渼陂,唐,万顷浸天色，千寻穷地根。舟移城入树，岸阔水浮村。闲鹭惊箫管，潜虬傍酒樽。暝来呼小吏，列火俨归轩。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Pan Mipi with the officials of Hu County,"Tens of thousands of hectares are immersed in the sky, and thousands of acres of poor roots are found. The boat moves the city into the tree, and the shore is wide and the water is floating in the village. The idle heron is startled by the flute pipe, and the latent Qiu is next to the wine bottle. Come to call the little official in the dark, and Lie Huo looks like returning to the porch."
边塞,岑参,与鲜于庶子自梓州成都少尹自褒城同行至利州道中作,唐,剖竹向西蜀，岷峨眇天涯。空深北阙恋，岂惮南路赊。前日登七盘，旷然见三巴。汉水出嶓冢，梁山控褒斜。栈道笼迅湍，行人贯层崖。岩倾劣通马，石窄难容车。深林怯魑魅，洞穴防龙蛇。水种新插秧，山田正烧畬。夜猿啸山雨，曙鸟鸣江花。过午方始饭，经时旋及瓜。数公各游宦，千里皆辞家。言笑忘羁旅，还如在京华。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Walked with Xianyu Shuzi from Zizhou Chengdu Shaoyin from Baocheng to the middle of Lizhou Road,"Cutting the bamboo to the west, Min'e is far away from the world. If you are in love with the North Que in the sky, you will not be afraid of credit on the South Road. The day before yesterday, I boarded the seven plates and saw Sanba in a wide range. The Han River flows out of the tomb, and Liangshan controls Baoxie. The plank road is fast and turbulent, and pedestrians pass through the cliffs. Rocks are bad for horses, and stones are narrow for cars. The deep forest is cowardly, and the cave is protected from dragons and snakes. Newly planted rice seedlings, Yamada is burning She. Apes whistling in the mountains and rain at night, birds singing in river flowers at dawn. Meals start after noon, and turn to melons over time. Several princes traveled in official positions, and they all resigned from home for thousands of miles. Talking and laughing and forgetting to stay in the brigade is still like being in Jinghua."
边塞,岑参,卫节度赤骠马歌,唐,君家赤骠画不得，一团旋风桃花色。红缨紫鞚珊瑚鞭，玉鞍锦鞯黄金勒。请君鞲出看君骑，尾长窣地如红丝。自矜诸马皆不及，却忆百金新买时。香街紫陌凤城内，满城见者谁不爱。扬鞭骤急白汗流，弄影行骄碧蹄碎。紫髯胡雏金剪刀，平明剪出三鬉高。枥上看时独意气，众中牵出偏雄豪。骑将猎向南山口，城南孤兔不复有。草头一点疾如飞，却使苍鹰翻向后。忆昨看君朝未央，鸣珂拥盖满路香。始知边将真富贵，可怜人马相辉光。男儿称意得如此，骏马长鸣北风起。待君东去埽胡尘，为君一日行千里。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Wei Jiedu Chipu Horse Song,"The red puss of the Jun family can't paint, it's a whirlwind of peach blossoms. Red tassels, purple scorpions, coral whips, jade saddles, brocade and gold lees. Please go out and see Junqi, whose tail is as long as red silk. All horses are inferior to self-esteem, but I remember when I bought it for a hundred gold. In Xiangjie Zimo Fengcheng, there is no one in the city who does not love it. Raising the whip, the white sweat flows suddenly, and the shadows are arrogant and the green hooves are broken. Purple beard and young golden scissors, Pingming cut out three curly heights. When you look at it from the top, you are alone, but you are a hero among the crowd. The cavalry will hunt towards the South Mountain Pass, and the lone rabbit in the south of the city will no longer exist. The head of the grass is as fast as flying, but it makes the goshawk turn backwards. Recalling yesterday when I saw Jun Chao Weiyang, Ming Ke embraced Lu Xiang. Only then did I know that the frontier generals are really rich and honorable, and the poor horse looks like a brilliance. The man was so satisfied, the horse roared and the north wind rose. Waiting for Jundong to go to Huchen, and travel thousands of miles a day for you."

边塞,岑参,天山雪歌送萧治归京,唐,天山有雪常不开，千峰万岭雪崔嵬。北风夜捲赤亭口，一夜天山雪更厚。能兼汉月照银山，复逐胡风过铁关。交河城边飞鸟绝，轮台路上马蹄滑。晻霭寒氛万里凝，阑干阴崖千丈冰。将军狐裘卧不暖，都护宝刀冻欲断。正是天山雪下时，送君走马归京师。雪中何以赠君别，惟有青青松树枝。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Tianshan Xuege sends Xiao Zhi back to Beijing,"There is snow in the Tianshan Mountains and it does not always open. Thousands of peaks and thousands of mountains are snowy. The north wind blows at Chitingkou at night, and the snow in the Tianshan Mountains becomes thicker overnight. It can also shine on the silver mountain of the Han moon, and chase Hu Feng through the iron pass. There are absolutely no flying birds on the edge of Jiaohe City, and horseshoes slippery on Luntai Road. The dark mist is cold and the atmosphere is condensed for thousands of miles, and the cliffs are thousands of feet cold. The general's fox fur is not warm when lying down, and the treasured sword of the guard is frozen to break. It was when the snow fell on the Tianshan Mountains that I sent you back to the capital on horseback. How can I give you a farewell in the snow, only the green pine branches."
边塞,岑参,太一石鳖崖口潭旧庐招王学士,唐,骤雨鸣淅沥，飕飗溪谷寒。碧潭千馀尺，下见蛟龙蟠。石门吞众流，绝岸呀层峦。幽趣倏万变，奇观非一端。偶逐干禄徒，十年皆小官。抱板寻旧圃，弊庐临迅湍。君子满清朝，小人思挂冠。酿酒漉松子，引泉通竹竿。何必濯沧浪，不能钓严滩。此地可遗老，劝君来考槃。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Taiyi Chiton Yakoutan old house recruits the king's bachelor,"The showers are whistling and pattering, and the valley is cold. The Bitan is more than a thousand feet long, and you can see Jiaolong pan below. Shimen swallows the flow of people, and the shore is endless. The humor is ever-changing, and the spectacle is not one end. Occasionally chased Qianlutu, and was a petty official for ten years. Hold the board to find the old garden, and the disadvantaged house is near the rapids. The gentleman is full of the Qing Dynasty, and the villain thinks about hanging the crown. Brewing pine nuts, leading springs to connect bamboo poles. Why wash the waves instead of fishing on Yantan. You can leave old people here, and I advise you to come and take a test."
边塞,岑参,太白东溪张老舍即事寄舍弟侄等,唐,渭上秋雨过，北风何骚骚。天晴诸山出，太白峰最高。主人东溪老，两耳生长毫。远近知百岁，子孙皆二毛。中庭井兰上，一架猕猴桃。石泉饭香粳，酒瓮开新槽。爱兹田中趣，始悟世上劳。我行有胜事，书此寄尔曹。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Taibai Dongxi Zhang Laoshe immediately sent his brother and nephew etc.,"Autumn rains on Weishang, how the north wind blows. When the sky is fine, the mountains come out, and Taibai Peak is the highest. The owner, Dongxi, is old, and his ears grow hairs. It is known from far and near that if you are a hundred years old, your descendants are all Ermao. On the Jinglan in the atrium, a kiwi fruit. The rice in Shiquan is fragrant, and the wine urn has a new slot. I love Tanaka's fun, and I first realized the work in the world. There are victories in my line, and I write this to Ercao."
边塞,岑参,太白胡僧歌,唐,闻有胡僧在太白，兰若去天三百尺。一持楞伽入中峰，世人难见但闻钟。窗边锡杖解两虎，床下钵盂藏一龙。草衣不针复不线，两耳垂肩眉覆面。此僧年几那得知，手种青松今十围。心将流水同清净，身与浮云无是非。商山老人已曾识，愿一见之何由得。山中有僧人不知，城里看山空黛色。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Taibai Hu Sengge,"I heard that monk Hu was in Taibai, and Lan Ruo went three hundred feet to the sky. As soon as you enter the middle peak with the Langa, it is difficult for the world to see but hear the bell. A tin stick by the window untangles two tigers, and a bowl hides a dragon under the bed. The grass clothes are neither stitched nor threaded, and the earlobes, shoulders and eyebrows cover the face. A few years ago, this monk learned that he planted green pine trees and is now ten rounds. The heart will be as pure as the flowing water, and there will be no right and wrong between the body and the floating clouds. The old man in Shangshan has known him before, and he would like to see him for a while. There are monks in the mountains who don't know, but in the city, the mountains are dark and empty."

The nectar falls to the court, and the sky shows selflessness. It's not like there are no other people's homes, so there are not many trees and branches. Be hereby Gantang tree, the United States called Bo poetry. Tuantuan is as sweet as honey, and condensed as fat. Qianke Yuguang shatters, and thousands of leaf beads hang down. When Kunlun will come, Qingyun will follow each other. The copper plate of the Wei palace was stored, and the emperor of the Han Dynasty was in charge of gold. Wang Zebu is a harmonious person, meticulous and active. Monarchs and ministers have the same virtues day by day, Zhenrui and Fang Qianshi. He Shuling Minister, Gantong can reach here. Sudden political shock and rationale, dark and fetish period. But he laughed at Zhao Zhang's generation, calling it a rarity in ancient times. For the sake of the king, the world will drink, and the rice cake will use up the time."

The fire clouds are all over the mountain and the mountains are still frozen, and the birds dare not come from thousands of miles away. In Pingming, Hu Feng is broken at first glance, and in the evening, it returns with the rain. Surrounded by oblique Tieguan trees, half-covered by the atmosphere, the river is garrisoned. Traveling all the way to Huoshan Mountain, the lonely cloud on the mountain followed the horse."
边塞,岑参,韦员外家花树歌,唐,今年花似去年好，去年人到今年老。始知人老不如花，可惜落花君莫埽。君家兄弟不可当，列卿御史尚书郎。朝回花底恒会客，花扑玉缸春酒香。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Song of Flowers and Trees in Wei Yuanwai's Family,"This year's flowers are as good as last year's, and last year's people are getting old this year. It is a pity that falling flowers are not as good as flowers. You can't be a brother of the Jun family, Lieqing Yushi Shangshulang. In the morning and back, the bottom of the flowers will always receive guests, and the flowers will be fragrant in the spring wine in the jade vat."
边塞,岑参,东归发犍为至泥溪舟中作,唐,前日解侯印，泛舟归山东。平旦发犍为，逍遥信回风。七月江水大，沧波涨秋空。复有峨眉僧，诵经在舟中。夜泊防虎豹，朝行逼鱼龙。一道鸣迅湍，两边走连峰。猿拂岸花落，鸟啼檐树重。烟霭吴楚连，溯沿湖海通。忆昨在西掖，复曾入南宫。日出朝圣人，端笏陪群公。不意今弃置，何由豁心胸。吾当海上去，且学乘桴翁。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,"Going back to the east, Fa Qianwei went to the Nixi boat to work","Xie Houyin the day before yesterday, went boating back to Shandong. Ping Dan made a strong call, and Xiaoyao believed in the wind. In July, the river is full of water, and the waves rise and the autumn sky rises. Then there are Emei monks, chanting scriptures in the boat. Guard against tigers and leopards at night, and force fish and dragons toward them. A sound of swift turbulence, walking on both sides of the peak. The ape blows the shore, the flowers fall, and the birds sing, and the trees are heavy. Misty Wu Chulian, back along the lake and sea. I recalled that I was in Xiye yesterday and entered Nangong again. Sunrise pilgrims, Duanhu accompany the group. I don't want to abandon it now, so why open my mind. I will go to the sea and learn to ride on the weng."
边塞,岑参,东归留题太常徐卿草堂,唐,不谢古名将，吾知徐太常。年才三十馀，勇冠西南方。顷曾策匹马，独出持两鎗。虏骑无数来，见君不敢当。汉将小卫霍，蜀将凌关张。卿月益清澄，将星转光芒。复居少城北，遥对岷山阳。车马日盈门，宾客常满堂。曲池荫高树，小径穿丛篁。江鸟飞入帘，山云来到床。题诗芭蕉滑，对酒棕花香。诸将射猎时，君在翰墨场。圣主赏勋业，边城最辉光。与我情绸缪，相知久芬芳。忽作万里别，东归三峡长。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Returning from the East to Taichang Xu Qing Thatched Cottage,"No thanks to the ancient famous general, I know Xu Taichang. He is only in his thirties, and he is brave in the southwest. Qing once rode a horse and held two guns alone. Countless captives came, but they dared not be kings. The Han general Xiaowei Huo, and the Shu general Ling Guanzhang. Qingyue is more clear and clear, turning the stars into light. He returned to live in the north of Shaocheng, facing Minshan Yang in the distance. The door is full of cars and horses every day, and the house is often full of guests. Quchi is shaded by tall trees, and the paths are pierced with clumps. Jiang Niao flew into the curtain, and Shan Yun came to the bed. The inscription is smooth with plantains and fragrant with wine palm flowers. When the generals were shooting and hunting, the king was in the pen and ink field. The Holy Lord rewards meritorious deeds, and the border town is the most glorious. Be ready for love with me, and know each other for a long time. Suddenly far away for thousands of miles, east to the Three Gorges."
边塞,岑参,东归晚次潼关怀古,唐,暮春别乡树，晚景低津楼。伯夷在首阳，欲往无轻舟。遂登关城望，下见洪河流。自从巨灵开，流血千万秋。行行潘生赋，赫赫曹公谋。川上多往事，凄凉满空洲。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Returning to the East in the Late Citong Caring for the Ancients,"In the late spring, there is a tree in the other country, and in the evening scene, the low Jin building. Boyi is in Shouyang, and there is no light boat to go. Then he boarded the pass and looked down at the Honghe River. Since the giant spirit opened, blood has been shed for thousands of years. Doing Pan Shengfu, Hehe Cao Gongmou. There are many past events in Sichuan, and Kongzhou is full of desolation."
边塞,岑参,冬夜宿仙游寺南凉堂呈谦道人,唐,太乙连太白，两山知几重。路盘石门窄，匹马行才通。日西倒山寺，林下逢支公。昨夜山北时，星星闻此钟。秦女去已久，仙台在中峰。箫声不可闻，此地留遗踪。石潭积黛色，每岁投金龙。乱流争迅湍，喷薄如雷风。夜来闻清磬，月出苍山空。空山满清光，水树相玲珑。回廊映密竹，秋殿隐深松。灯影落前溪，夜宿水声中。爱兹林峦好，结宇向溪东。相识唯山僧，邻家一钓翁。林晚栗初拆，枝寒梨已红。物幽兴易惬，事胜趣弥浓。愿谢区中缘，永依金人宫。寄报乘辇客，簪裾尔何容。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,"Overnight at the South Hall of Xianyou Temple, Taoist Chengqian","Taiyi is connected with Taibai, the two mountains know how heavy they are. The stone gate on the road plate is narrow, and only horses can pass through it. In the west of the sun, the mountain temple is turned down, and Zhigong meets under the forest. In the north of the mountain last night, the stars heard the bell. Qin Nu has been gone for a long time, and Xiantai is in Zhongfeng. The sound of the flute cannot be heard, leaving traces here. The stone pond accumulates black color, and casts golden dragons every year. The turbulent current competes for the rapid turbulence, gushing like a thunderstorm. Come at night to hear the chime, and the moon rises to the sky in Cangshan Mountain. The empty mountain is full of clear light, and the water and trees are exquisite. The cloister reflects dense bamboo, and the autumn hall hides deep pine. The shadow of the lamp falls on the Qianxi River, and sleeps in the sound of the water at night. Aizlin's mountains are good, and Jieyu Xiangxidong. I know only a mountain monk, and a fisherman next door. Lin Wanli was first dismantled, and the branches of cold pears were already red. Things are quiet and easy to enjoy, and things are more interesting. I would like to thank the middle edge of the district and stay in the Jinren Palace forever. Sending newspapers to passengers in chariots, what is your hairpin and train."
边塞,岑参,冬宵家会饯李郎司兵赴同州,唐,急管杂青丝，玉瓶金屈卮。寒天高堂夜，扑地飞雪时。贺君关西掾，新绶腰下垂。白面皇家郎，逸翮青云姿。明旦之官去，他辰良会稀。惜别冬夜短，务欢杯行迟。季女犹自小，老夫未令归。且看匹马行，不得鸣凤飞。昔岁到冯翊，人烟接京师。曾上月楼头，遥见西岳祠。沙苑逼官舍，莲峰压城池。多暇或自公，读书复弹棋。州县信徒劳，云霄亦可期。应须力为政，聊慰此相思。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,The Winter Xiao family will present Li Lang and his soldiers to Tongzhou,"Urgent management of miscellaneous green silk, jade bottle gold quxie. In the cold sky and night, when the snow is falling on the ground. Jun He is in Guanxi, and Xinshou's waist is drooping. White-faced Royal Lang, Yi He Qingyun Zi. Ming Dan's official will go, and his Chen Liang will be rare. Say goodbye to the short winter nights, and it will be too late to enjoy the cup. The daughter-in-law of Ji was still young, and the old man did not order her to return. Let's watch a horse go, but don't fly like a phoenix. When I arrived at Feng Yi in the past, people took over the capital. I once went to the top of the moon building and saw Xiyue Temple in the distance. Shayuan presses down on government houses, and lotus peaks press down on cities. If you have too much time or selfishness, read books and play chess again. The believers in the states and counties work hard, and the clouds can also be expected. We should do our best to govern, and talk about comforting this lovesickness."
边塞,岑参,出关经华岳寺访法华云公,唐,野寺聊解鞍，偶见法华僧。开门对西岳，石壁青棱层。竹径厚苍苔，松门盘紫藤。长廊列古画，高殿悬孤灯。五月山雨热，三峰火云蒸。侧闻樵人言，深谷犹积冰。久愿寻此山，至今嗟未能。谪官忽东走，王程苦相仍。欲去恋双树，何由穷一乘。月轮吐山郭，夜色空清澄。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Passing through Huayue Temple to visit Fahuayungong,"The wild temple chatted to untie the saddle, and occasionally saw the Fahua monk. Open the door to Huashan Mountain, with green ridges on the stone wall. The bamboo path is thick with moss, and the wisteria on the pine door. Ancient paintings are lined up in the promenade, and solitary lamps are hung in the high hall. In May, the mountains are rainy and hot, and the three peaks are steaming with fire and clouds. I heard the woodcutter say that the deep valley is still covered with ice. I have long wanted to find this mountain, but so far I have not been able to. The exiled official suddenly left, and Wang Cheng remained bitter. If you want to fall in love with two trees, why should you be poor? The moon spits out the mountains, and the night sky is clear."
边塞,岑参,北庭西郊候封大夫受降回军献上,唐,胡地苜蓿美，轮台征马肥。大夫讨匈奴，前月西出师。甲兵未得战，降虏来如归。橐驼何连连，穹帐亦累累。阴山烽火灭，剑水羽书稀。却笑霍嫖姚，区区徒尔为。西郊候中军，平沙悬落晖。驿马从西来，双节夹路驰。喜鹊捧金印，蛟龙盘画旗。如公未四十，富贵能及时。直上排青云，傍看疾若飞。前年斩楼兰，去岁平月支。天子日殊宠，朝廷方见推。何幸一书生，忽蒙国士知。侧身佐戎幕，敛衽事边陲。自逐定远侯，亦著短后衣。近来能走马，不弱并州儿。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,The Doctor Hou Feng in the western suburbs of Beiting was surrendered and returned to the army to present,"Hudi alfalfa is beautiful, Luntai levy horse manure. The doctor begged the Xiongnu, and he left his army in the west the month before last. The armored soldiers did not win the battle, and the captives came as if they had returned. There are so many camels, and so many dome tents. The beacon fire in Yinshan is extinguished, and the book of Jianshuiyu is thin. But he laughed at Huo whoring Yao, which was nothing. Waiting for the Chinese army in the western suburbs, Pingsha hangs in the sunset. The stage horses come from the west, galloping across the road in double festivals. Magpies hold gold seals, dragons draw flags. If the public is not yet forty, wealth can be achieved in time. Straight up the row of blue clouds, watching from the sidelines is like flying. The year before last, Loulan was chopped off, and the year before last was Pingyuezhi. The emperor favors him every day, and the court only sees it. He Xing was a scholar who was suddenly known to the scholars of Mongolia. Standing sideways to assist the Rongmu, the frontier is held together. Since the Marquis of Dingyuan, he also wears a short back coat. Recently, he has been able to walk on horseback, not weak and stateless."
边塞,岑参,北庭作,唐,雁塞通盐泽，龙堆接醋沟。孤城天北畔，绝域海西头。秋雪春仍下，朝风夜不休。可知年四十，犹自未对侯。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Bei Tingzuo,"Yansai leads to Yanze, and Longdui connects to vinegar ditch. On the north side of the lonely city, on the west side of the sea. Autumn snow is still falling in spring, and the wind is endless at night. It can be seen that at the age of forty, I still haven't met him."
边塞,岑参,北庭贻宗学士道别,唐,万事不可料，叹君在军中。读书破万卷，何事来从戎。曾逐李轻车，西征出太蒙。荷戈月窟外，擐甲昆崙东。两度皆破胡，朝廷轻战功。十年祗一命，万里如飘蓬。容鬓老胡尘，衣裘脆边风。忽来轮台下，相见披心胸。饮酒对春草，弹棋闻夜钟。今且还龟兹，臂上悬角弓。平沙向旅馆，匹马随飞鸿。孤城倚大碛，海气迎边空。四月犹自寒，天山雪濛濛。君有贤主将，何谓泣途穷。时来整六翮，一举凌苍穹。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Bachelor Yizong of Beiting bids farewell,"Everything is unpredictable, sigh you are in the army. If you read thousands of volumes, why should you join the army? Once chased Li Qingche, marched west out of Taimeng. Outside the Hege Moon Cave, to the east of Kunlun. The Hu was broken twice, and the imperial court made light of military exploits. There is only one life in ten years, and a thousand miles is like a floating canopy. The old beard on the temples is dusty, and the clothes are crisp and windy. Suddenly come under the wheel platform, meet each other with a heart. Drinking wine against spring grass, playing chess and hearing the night bell. Now let’s go back to Kucha, with a horned bow hanging on his arm. Pingsha to the hotel, horses follow Feihong. The isolated city leans against a large moraine, and the air of the sea faces the sky. It's still cold in April, and the Tianshan Mountains are covered with snow. If you have a virtuous ruler and general, what does it mean to cry and be poor? From time to time, the whole Liuhe will reach the sky in one fell swoop."
边塞,岑参,司马相如琴台,唐,相如琴台古，人去台亦空。台上寒萧条，至今多悲风。荒台汉时月，色与旧时同。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Sima Xiangru Qintai,"It is like an ancient Qintai, and when people go to the platform, it will be empty. The stage is cold and depressed, and it is so sad. In the barren Taiwan and the Han Dynasty, the color is the same as in the old days."
边塞,岑参,左仆射相国冀公东斋幽居,唐,丞相百僚长，两朝居此官。成功云雷际，翊圣天地安。不矜南宫贵，祗向东山看。宅占凤城胜，窗中云岭宽。午时松轩夕，六月藤斋寒。玉佩罥女萝，金印耀牡丹。山蝉上衣桁，野鼠缘药盘。有时披道书，竟日不著冠。幸得趋省闱，常欣在门阑。何当复持衡，短翮期风抟。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Zuo Pushe Xiangguo Jigong Dongzhai Residence,"The prime minister is the head of the hundred bureaucrats, who lived in this official during the two dynasties. Success is clouded with thunder, and Yi Sheng is safe. I don't care about Nangonggui, but only look at Dongshan. The house occupies Fengcheng Sheng, and the clouds and mountains in the window are wide. At noon, Songxuan is at night, and Fujisai is cold in June. The jade pendant is a female radish, and the golden seal is a peony. Mountain cicada's coat stringer, wild rat's medicine plate. Sometimes I don't wear a crown when I wear Taoist books. Fortunately, Chang Xin was in the doorway when he was in the province. He Dangfu maintains the balance, and the wind is in a short period of time."
边塞,岑参,灭胡曲,唐,都护新灭胡，士马气亦粗。萧条虏尘净，突兀天山孤。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Mie Hu Qu,"The general protects the new Hu, and the spirit of the soldiers and horses is also rough. The depression is clean, the Tianshan Mountain is abrupt and lonely."
边塞,岑参,玉门关盖将军歌,唐,盖将军，真丈夫，行年三十执金吾，身长七尺颇有须。玉门关城迥且孤，黄沙万里白草枯。南邻犬戎北接胡，将军到来备不虞。五千甲兵胆力粗，军中无事但欢娱。暖屋绣帘红地炉，织成壁衣花氍毹。灯前侍婢泻玉壶，金铛乱点野酡酥。紫绂金章左右趋，问着只是苍头奴。美人一双闲且都，朱唇翠眉映明矑。清歌一曲世所无，今日喜闻凤将雏。可怜绝胜秦罗敷，使君五马谩踟蹰。野草绣窠紫罗襦，红牙缕马对樗蒱。玉盘纤手撒作卢，众中誇道不曾输。枥上昂昂皆骏驹，桃花叱拨价最殊。骑将猎向城南隅，腊日射杀千年狐。我来塞外按边储，为君取醉酒剩沽。醉争酒盏相喧呼，忽忆咸阳旧酒徒。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Song of General Gai at Yumen Pass,"General Gai, the real husband, is a thirty-year-old Jinwu, seven feet long and has a beard. The city of Yumenguan is remote and lonely, with thousands of miles of yellow sand and dry grass. The south is adjacent to Quanrong and the north is connected to Hu, and the general's arrival is not in danger. The five thousand armored soldiers are courageous and strong, and there is nothing but joy in the army. The warm house has embroidered curtains and a red-floor stove, woven into wall coverings and flowers. In front of the lamp, the maidservant pours out the jade pot, and the golden pan lights wild crisps randomly. The purple and gold medals are left and right, and it is only the head slave who asks. A pair of beauties are free and full, with vermilion lips and emerald eyebrows shining brightly. There is no such thing as a Qing song in the world. Today I am happy to hear about the young phoenix. The pitiful victory over Qin Luofu made Jun Wuma hesitant. Wild grasses embroidered nests of purple Luo Ru, red teeth threaded horses paired with weeds. The slender hand of the jade plate was cast as Lu, and the crowd boasted that they had never lost. All horses are high and proud, and the peach blossoms are the most special. The cavalry general hunted to the south corner of the city, and shot and killed the thousand-year-old fox in La Ri. I came to press the border reserve outside the Great Wall, and bought the leftovers of drunkenness for you. Drunken and fighting for wine cups, shouting at each other, suddenly recalling the old drunkards in Xianyang."
边塞,岑参,田使君美人舞如莲花北鋋歌,唐,美人舞如莲花旋，世人有眼应未见。高堂满地红氍毹，试舞一曲天下无。此曲胡人传入汉，诸客见之惊且叹。慢脸娇娥纤复秾，轻罗金缕花葱茏。回裾转袖若飞雪，左鋋右鋋生旋风。琵琶横笛和未匝，花门山头黄云合。忽作出塞入塞声，白草胡沙寒飒飒。翻身入破如有神，前见后见回回新。始知诸曲不可比，采莲落梅徒聒耳。世人学舞祗是舞，恣态岂能得如此。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Tian Shijun beauty dances like a lotus flower and sings in the north,"The dance of beauties is like a lotus flower, and the world should not have seen it. The high hall is full of red 氍毹, and there is no dance in the world. This song was introduced to the Han people by the Hu people, and all the guests were surprised and sighed when they saw it. The slow-faced Jiao'e is slender and thick, and the golden hazel flowers are light and verdant. Turning back the train and turning the sleeves is like flying snow, and the left and right are creating a whirlwind. Pipa, Hengdi and Weiza, Huang Yunhe on the top of Huamen Mountain. Suddenly there was a stuffing sound, and the white grass and grass rustled coldly. If you stand up and break through, if you have a god, you will see the past and see the future, and you will return to the new. I realized that all songs are incomparable, picking lotus and falling plums is just noisy. People in the world learn to dance only to dance, how can they be so unrestrained."
边塞,岑参,白雪歌送武判官归京,唐,北风捲地白草折，胡天八月即飞雪。忽如一夜春风来，千树万树梨花开。散入珠帘湿罗幕，狐裘不煖锦衾薄。将军角弓不得控，都护铁衣冷难着。瀚海阑干百丈冰，愁云黪淡万里凝。中军置酒饮归客，胡琴琵琶与羌笛。纷纷暮雪下辕门，风掣红旗冻不翻。轮台东门送君去，去时雪满天山路。山回路转不见君，雪上空留马行处。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Bai Xuege sends Judge Wu back to Beijing,"The north wind blows the ground and the white grass breaks, and Hu Tian is snowing in August. Suddenly, like a spring breeze overnight, thousands of trees and pear trees bloom. Scattered into the bead curtain and wet Luo curtain, the fox fur is not warm, and the brocade quilt is thin. The general can't control his horn bow, and the iron coat of the general's guard is hard to wear. The vast sea is surrounded by hundreds of feet of ice, and the melancholy clouds are pale and ten thousand li condensed. The Chinese army buys wine and drinks for returning guests, Huqin, lute and Qiangdi. Dusk snow falls down the gate one after another, and the red flag is frozen by the wind and cannot be turned over. The east gate of Luntai saw you off, and the Tianshan Road was covered with snow. You can't see you when you turn around the mountain circuit, and stay in the horse riding place in the sky above the snow."

边塞,岑参,优钵罗花歌,唐,白山南，赤山北，其间有花人不识。绿茎碧叶好颜色，叶六瓣，花九房，夜掩朝开多异香，何不生彼中国兮生西方？移根在庭，媚我公堂，耻与众草之为伍，何亭亭而独芳？何不为人之所赏兮？深山穷谷委严霜。吾窃悲阳关道路长，曾不得献于君王。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,ubara flower song,"In the south of Baishan Mountain and in the north of Chishan Mountain, there are flowers that people don't know. Green stems and green leaves, good color, six petals, nine flowers, cover the morning at night and bloom with a lot of fragrance, why not be born in China and in the West? Move your roots in the court, flatter me in the court, and be ashamed to be with the grass, how can it stand alone and be fragrant? Why not be rewarded by others? In the deep mountains and poor valleys, there is severe frost. I feel sorry for the long road of Yangguan, and I was never able to offer it to the king."

边塞,岑参,刘相公中书江山画障,唐,相府徵墨妙，挥毫天地穷。始知丹青笔，能夺造化功。潇湘在帘间，庐壑横座中。忽疑凤凰池，暗与江海通。粉白湖上云，黛青天际峰。昼日恒见月，孤帆如有风。岩花不飞落，涧草无春冬。担锡香炉缁，钓鱼沧浪翁。如何平津意，尚想尘外踪。富贵心独轻，山林兴弥浓。喧幽趣颇异，出处事不同。请君为苍生，未可追赤松。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Liu Xianggong Zhongshu Jiangshan painting barrier,"The prime minister's mansion is so wonderful that the world is poor. Only then did I know that the Danqing pen can win the power of good fortune. Xiaoxiang is between the curtains, and in the horizontal seat of Luhe. Suddenly suspicious of Phoenix Pond, secretly connected with Jiang Hai. There are clouds on the pink and white lake, and the blue sky is the peak. The moon is always seen in the day and day, and the lonely sail is like the wind. Rock flowers don't fly down, and grass doesn't have spring and winter. Carrying tin incense burner, fishing Canglang Weng. How to make peace in Tianjin, I still want to leave the dust. The heart of wealth is light, and the mountains and forests are full of prosperity. The noise and the fun are quite different, and the origins are different. Please be the common people, don't chase after the red pine."

Looking east to the white pavilion cloud, half into the purple pavilion pine. There are many victories, and Hengmen is full of fun. Fortunately, there are several acres of land, so I have to extend the second trace. Hearing Dashi's language early, I occasionally communicate with my heart. Mistakenly favoring a micro-official, but also ashamed of the dust. There is no longer a fishing rod, and no one is pounding the wild reed. Melancholy, the birds are gone, Nanxi hears the night bell."
边塞,岑参,安西馆中思长安,唐,家在日出处，朝来起东风。风从帝乡来，不异家信通。绝域地欲尽，孤城天遂穷。弥年但走马，终日随飘蓬。寂寞不得意，辛勤方在公。胡尘净古塞，兵气屯边空。乡路眇天外，归期如梦中。遥凭长房术，为缩天山东。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Anxi Pavilion Thinking of Chang'an,"The home is at the sunrise, and the east wind blows from the north. The wind comes from the emperor's hometown, and it is not different from the family. The land is almost exhausted, and the lonely city is poor. Even though he is young, he is on a horse, and he is floating all day long. Lonely and unhappy, hard work is in the public. Hu Chen cleans the ancient fortress, and the military spirit is empty. The country road is far away, and the return date is like a dream. Relying on the long room technique, it is Shandong Province that shrinks the sky."
边塞,岑参,巩北秋兴寄崔明允,唐,白露披梧桐，玄蝉昼夜号。秋风万里动，日暮黄云高。君子佐休明，小人事蓬蒿。所适在鱼鸟，焉能徇锥刀。孤舟向广武，一鸟归成皋。胜概日相与，思君心郁陶。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Gong Bei Qiuxing sent Cui Mingyun,"The white dew is covered with phoenix trees, and the Xuan Chan is numbered day and night. The autumn wind is moving thousands of miles, and the sun is setting and the clouds are high. The gentleman is Zuo Xiuming, and the little person is Penghao. It is suitable for fish and birds, so how can they play tricks. A lone boat goes to Guangwu, and a bird goes to Chenggao. Winning and meeting with each other every day, Sijun's heart is full of depression."
边塞,岑参,戏问花门酒家翁,唐,老人七十仍沽酒，千壶百瓮花门口。道傍榆荚仍似钱，摘来沽酒君肯否。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Ask the old man of Huamen Restaurant,"The old man is still selling wine at seventy, thousands of pots and hundreds of urns are spent at the door.

边塞,岑参,早上五盘岭,唐,平旦驱驷马，旷然出五盘。江回两崖斗，日隐群峰攒。苍翠烟景曙，森沈云树寒。松疏露孤驿，花密藏回滩。栈道溪雨滑，畬田原草乾。此行为知己，不觉蜀道难。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Wupanling in the morning,"Pingdan drove the four horses, and played five dishes in a wild way. Jianghui fights on two cliffs, and the sun hides from the peaks. The green smoke is green and the scenery is dawn, the forest is cloudy and the trees are cold. The pine is sparse and the lonely post is exposed, and the flowers are hidden back to the beach. The plank road is rainy and slippery, and the grass in Shetian is dry. This behavior is a confidant, and I don't realize that the road to Shu is difficult."
边塞,岑参,江上阻风雨,唐,江上风欲来，泊舟未能发。气昏雨已过，突兀山复出。积浪成高丘，盘涡为嵌窟。云低岸花掩，水涨滩草没。老树蛇蜕皮，崩崖龙退骨。平生抱忠信，艰险殊可忽。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Wind and rain on the river,"The wind on the river is about to come, but the boat cannot be moored. The weather is faint and the rain has passed, and the sudden mountain has come back. Accumulated waves form high hills, and eddies form embedded caves. The clouds are low and the flowers on the shore are covered, and the water is rising and the grass is gone. The old tree snake sheds its skin, and the cliff-breaking dragon retreats. To be loyal and trustworthy in life, hardships and dangers are negligible."
边塞,岑参,江行遇梅花之作,唐,江畔梅花白如雪，使我思乡肠欲断。摘得一枝在手中，无人远向金闺说。愿得青鸟衔此花，西飞直送到我家。胡姬正在临窗下，独织留黄浅碧纱。此鸟衔花胡姬前，胡姬见花知我怜。千说万说由不得，一夜抱花空馆眠。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Jiang Xing meets Plum Blossom,"The plum blossoms by the riverside are as white as snow, making me homesick. I picked a branch in my hand, and no one said it to the golden boudoir. May the blue bird hold this flower and fly directly to my home. Orchid is under the window, weaving a yellow and light green gauze by herself. This bird holds the flower in front of the orchid, and the orchid knows my pity when she sees the flower. I can't help but hold flowers and sleep in the empty hall all night."
边塞,岑参,自潘陵尖还少室居止秋夕凭眺,唐,草堂近少室，夜静闻风松。月出潘陵尖，照见十六峰。九月山叶赤，溪云淡秋容。火点伊阳村，烟深嵩角钟。尚子不可见，蒋生难再逢。胜惬只自知，佳趣为谁浓。昨诣山僧期，上到天坛东。向下望雷雨，云间见回龙。夕与人群疏，转爱丘壑中。心澹水木会，兴幽鱼鸟通。稀微了自释，出处乃不同。况本无宦情，誓将依道风。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,"Since Pan Lingjian still has a few houses to live in, look at the autumn evening","The thatched cottage is close to the young room, and the night is quiet and the wind is heard. When the moon rises from the tip of Panling, one can see the Sixteen Peaks. In September, the leaves of the mountains are red, and the clouds in the stream are pale in autumn. The fire point is Yiyang Village, the smoke is deep and the Songjiao bell is deep. If Shangzi is invisible, Jiang Sheng will never meet again. Victory is only self-knowledge, who is more interesting. Yesterday I became a mountain monk and went to the east of the Temple of Heaven. Looking down at the thunderstorm, you can see Huilong among the clouds. In the evening, I will be separated from the crowd, and I will turn to love in the hills and valleys. The heart is fresh, the water and the trees will meet, and the fish and birds will pass through the quiet. The self-explanation is rare, but the source is different. Kuang Ben has no eunuch feelings, and vows to follow the Dao wind."
边塞,岑参,至大梁却寄匡城主人,唐,一从弃鱼钓，十载干明王。无由谒天阶，却欲归沧浪。仲秋至东郡，遂见天雨霜。昨日梦故山，蕙草色已黄。平明辞铁丘，薄暮游大梁。仲秋萧条景，拔刺飞鹅鸧。四郊阴气闭，万里无晶光。长风吹白茅，野火烧枯桑。故人南燕吏，籍籍名更香。聊以玉壶赠，置之君子堂。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,"To Daliang, but sent to the owner of Kuang City","Once from abandoning fish to catch, ten years to become king of Ming Dynasty. There is no reason to visit the heavenly steps, but I want to return to Canglang. When I arrived in Dongjun in mid-autumn, I saw rain and frost in the sky. Dreaming of Gushan yesterday, the color of Huicao has turned yellow. Resign from Tieqiu in Pingming, and travel to Daliang in the evening. In the mid-autumn depression, the geese fly with their thorns. The surrounding suburbs are cloudy, and there is no crystal light for thousands of miles. The long wind blows the white grass, and the wild fire burns the mulberry. The old Nanyan official, his family name is more fragrant. Talk about giving it as a gift from a jade pot, and put it in the gentleman's hall."
边塞,岑参,行军诗二首 其一,唐,吾窃悲此生，四十幸未老。一朝逢世乱，终日不自保。胡兵夺长安，宫殿生野草。伤心五陵树，不见二京道。我皇在行军，兵马日浩浩。胡雏尚未灭，诸将恳征讨。昨闻咸阳败，杀戮净如扫。积尸若丘山，流血涨丰镐。干戈碍乡国，豺虎满城堡。村落皆无人，萧条空桑枣。儒生有长策，无处豁怀抱。块然伤时人，举首哭苍昊。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,One of Two Marching Poems,"secretly mourn this life, fortunately I am not old at forty. Once the world is chaotic, you can't protect yourself all day long. Hu Bing seized Chang'an, and weeds grew in the palace. Sad Wuling tree, no Erjing Road. My emperor is marching, and the soldiers and horses are magnificent day by day. Hu Chu has not yet been destroyed, and the generals are eager to conquer. Yesterday I heard that Xianyang was defeated, and the slaughter was as clean as sweeping. The corpses piled up like hills, and the blood swelled. Fighting against the country, jackals and tigers filled the castle. There is no one in the village, and the depression is empty. Confucian scholars have long-term strategies, but there is nowhere to embrace them. Huan Ran hurt the person at the time, raised his head and cried Cang Hao."
边塞,岑参,行军诗二首 其二,唐,早知逢世乱，少小谩读书。悔不学弯弓，向东射狂胡。偶从谏官列，谬向丹墀趋。未能匡吾君，虚作一丈夫。抚剑伤世路，哀歌泣良图。功业今已迟，览镜悲白须。平生抱忠义，不敢私微躯。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Two Marching Poems,"If I knew that the world was in turmoil, I would study at a young age. Regret not to learn how to bend the bow, and shoot the wild beard eastward. Even from the admonishment official list, the fallacy tends to Dan Chi. If you can't get my lord back, you will pretend to be a husband. Touching the sword hurts the world, mourning songs and weeping for good pictures. It's too late for merit, and the mirror is sad with white beard. I have been loyal and righteous all my life, and I dare not be private."
边塞,岑参,西亭子送李司马,唐,高高亭子郡城西，直上千尺与云齐。盘崖缘壁试攀跻，群山向下飞鸟低。使君五马天半嘶，丝绳玉壶为君提。坐来一望无端倪，红花绿柳莺乱啼。千家万井连回溪，酒行未醉闻暮鸡，点笔操纸为君题。为君题，惜解携，草萋萋，没马蹄。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Xitingzi sends Li Sima off,"To the west of Gaogao Tingzi County, it goes straight up to thousands of feet and is even with the clouds. Try to climb the edge of the cliff, and the mountains are flying down. Make you five horses and half-neigh, and the silk rope and jade pot will be carried by you. Sit down and see nothing, red flowers and green willow warblers sing chaotically. Thousands of homes and wells connect back to the stream, and the wine shop is not drunk and smells chickens at dusk, so write your pen and paper for your title. For the king's question, I cherish the solution, the grass is luxuriant, and there is no horseshoe."
边塞,岑参,西蜀旅舍春叹寄朝中故人呈狄评事,唐,春与人相乖，柳青头转白。生平未得意，览镜私自惜。四海犹未安，一身无所适。自从兵戈动，遂觉天地窄。功业悲后时，光阴叹虚掷。却为文章累，幸有开济策。何负当途人，无心矜窘厄。回瞻后来者，皆欲肆轥轹。起草思南宫，寄言忆西掖。时危任舒卷，身退知损益。穷巷草转深，闲门日将夕。桥西暮雨黑，篱外春江碧。昨者初识君，相看俱是客。声华同道术，世业通往昔。早须归天阶，不得安孔席。吾先税归鞅，旧国如咫尺。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,"Spring Sigh at Xishu Hotel Sends Comments to Cheng Di, an Old Man in the Dynasty","Spring is good with others, and Liu Qing's head turns white. I am not proud in my life, and I cherish it privately. The four seas are still not at ease, and the whole body is at a loss. Ever since the war started, I felt that the world was narrow. When the achievements are sad, the time is wasted. But I am tired of the article, fortunately there is a relief plan. Why should you be a passer-by, unintentionally embarrassing. Looking back at the latecomers, they all want to make a fuss. Drafting Sinan Palace, sending words to recall Xiye. When the danger is at ease, you will know the profit and loss when you retire. The grass in the poor alley turns deep, and the day of the idle door is coming to an end. The west of the bridge is rainy and dark, and the river is green in spring outside the fence. Those who met you for the first time yesterday were all guests. Shenghua is the same as Taoism, and the world's career leads to the past. You must return to the heavenly ranks early, and you must not settle down in the Confucian seats. I first return the tax to the martingale, and the old country is just around the corner."
边塞,岑参,过王判官西津所居,唐,胜迹不在远，爱君池馆幽。素怀岩中诺，宛得尘外游。何必到清溪，忽来见沧洲。潜移岷山石，暗引巴江流。树密昼先夜，竹深夏已秋。沙鸟上笔床，溪花彗帘钩。夫子贱簪冕，注心向林丘。落日出公堂，垂纶乘钓舟。赋诗忆楚老，载酒随江鸥。翛然一傲吏，独在西津头。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,The residence of Judge Guo Xijin,"The places of interest are not far away, Aijun Chiguan is secluded. Su Huai Yan Zhongnuo, Wan Dechen travels abroad. Why go to Qingxi and suddenly come to see Cangzhou. Subtly moving the Minshan rocks, secretly leading the Bajiang River. When the trees are dense, the day is the first night, and when the bamboo is deep, summer is already autumn. The sand bird is on the pen bed, and the curtain hook of the stream flowers and comets. The master's hairpin crown is cheap, and his heart is on Lin Qiu. The setting sun goes out of the court, and fishing takes a fishing boat. Compose poems to recall the old man of Chu, and carry wine with Jiangou. He is a proud official, alone in Xijintou."
边塞,岑参,过梁州奉赠张尚书大夫公,唐,汉中二良将，今昔各一时。韩信此登坛，尚书复来斯。手把铜虎符，身总丈人师。错落北斗星，照耀黑水湄。英雄若神授，大材济时危。顷岁遇雷云，精神感灵祇。勋业振青史，恩德继鸿私。羌虏昔未平，华阳积僵尸。人烟绝墟落，鬼火依城池。巴汉空水流，褒斜惟鸟飞。自公布德政，此地生光辉。百堵创里闾，千家恤茕嫠。层城重鼓角，甲士如熊罴。坐啸风自调，行春雨仍随。芃芃麦苗长，蔼蔼桑叶肥。浮客相与来，群盗不敢窥。何幸承嘉惠，小年即相知。富贵情易疏，相逢心不移。置酒宴高馆，娇歌杂青丝。锦席绣拂庐，玉盘金屈卮。春景透高戟，江云彗长麾。枥马嘶柳阴，美人映花枝。门传大夫印，世拥上将旗。承家令名扬，许国苦节施。戎幕宁久驻，台阶不应迟。别有弹冠士，希君无见遗。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Passing Liangzhou as a gift to Mr. Zhang Shangshu,"There are two good generals in Hanzhong, one in the past and one in the past. Han Xin came to the altar this time, and Shangshu returned to Sri Lanka. Holding the bronze tiger talisman in his hand, he is the master of the body. Scattered Big Dipper stars, shining on Heishuimei. If a hero is bestowed by the gods, he will be able to save the time. When you encounter thunderclouds at an early age, your spirit is only inspired. Honored career revitalizes history, and kindness inherits private interests. The Qiang captives have not been peaceful in the past, and Huayang has accumulated zombies. There are absolutely no people in the villages, and ghost fires are in the city. The Bahan is empty and the water is flowing, but the birds are flying in the praise. Since the announcement of benevolent government, this place has brilliance. Hundreds of blocks create Lilu, and thousands of families sympathize with Qiong. Layers of the city are heavy with drums and horns, and soldiers are like bears. Sitting on the whistling wind and self-adjusting, the spring rain still follows. Pengpeng wheat seedlings are long, and mulberry leaves are fat. Floating guests come with each other, and the group of thieves dare not peep. He Xing Cheng Jiahui, we have known each other since we were young. Wealth and honor are easy to scatter, and the heart will never change when you meet. There is a high hall for banquets, and charming songs are mixed with blue silk. Brocade seats are embroidered in the hut, and jade plates are decorated with gold. The spring scene is through the high halberd, and Jiang Yun's comet is long. Tochima neighs willow shade, beauty reflects flowering branches. The doctor's seal is passed on by the door, and the world holds the flag of the general. Inheriting the family order is famous, Xu Guo is hardworking. The army should be stationed for a long time, and the steps should not be late. Don't have a champion, I hope you have nothing to see."
边塞,岑参,过缑山王处士黑石谷隐居,唐,旧居缑山下，偏识缑山云。处士久不还，见云如见君。别来逾十秋，兵马日纷纷。青溪开战场，黑谷屯行军。遂令巢由辈，远逐麋鹿群。独有南涧水，潺湲如昔闻。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Goushan Wang Chushi lived in seclusion in Heishi Valley,"used to live at the foot of Mount Gou, but I know the clouds in Mount Gou. If a scholar does not return for a long time, seeing the cloud is like seeing the king. Don't come more than ten autumns, there will be soldiers and horses day by day. Qingxi opened the battlefield, and Heigutun marched. So he ordered the nest to go from generation to generation, chasing the elk far away. The Nanjian water is unique, and the gurgling is as old as the past."

If you are in love with dogs and horses in the air, how can you think of walking with egrets? There are many rivers and lakes in Su, and it is also a town of mountains and rivers. The courtyard is full of quiet moon, and the rolling curtain stream is cool with rain. The bamboo in the window is green and wet, and the lotus is fragrant in the case. The white bird coat stringer, the moss grows the pen bed. The number of public is invisible, don't forget each other. Dare to hate Qing Suoke, ruthless Hua Shenglang. In the early years, I was fascinated and retreated, but in the late days, I realized Xingzang. I can visit each other in the future, the old thatched cottage in Songnan."

From Pingming to Xianyang, at dusk to the top of Longshan Mountain. Longshui is not audible, sobbing is worrying. The sand and dust beat the horse sweat, and the fog and dew condensed the sable fur. Whose family is from the west, he will be a new Marquis. Anxi was dispatched the month before last, and there was no stop on the road. The guardian has not yet arrived, but was in Xizhou when he came. Ten days pass through the moraine, and the wind will never stop. The horse walked on the gravel, blood flowed from all four hooves. Thousands of miles to serve the king, nothing to ask for. I also know that Saiyuan is suffering, how can I plan for my wife. The moon is about to come out of the mountain pass, so first take care of the gate tower. The stream and the pine wind are blowing in the quiet night. Do not rely on dreams of returning home, and there are many mountains and sorrows. Join hands with your son, and don't worry about repairing the road ahead."

The Xiongnu's grass and yellow horses are fattening, and the smoke and dust are flying in the west of Jinshan. The general of the Han family went west, and the general's golden armor never took off at night. In the middle of the night, the army marched against each other, and the limelight was like a knife, and the face was like a cut. The horse hair is steamed with snow and sweat, and the five flowers and money are turned into ice. In the middle of the curtain, the grass and the inkstone are coagulated, and the captives should be frightened when they hear it. It is expected that the short soldiers dare not pick up, and the chariot master Ximen stands up to offer victory."

He was dismissed from Nanshu and came to Zichuan on a false road. Looking at the clouds on the balcony, I feel melancholy and dare not move forward. The emperor's hometown is near the north, and Lukou is connected to the man in the south. When He Dang met the long house, he shrank to Jingguan. I wish to follow the piano high and ride the fish to the clouds. Every time the Lord of the Ming Dynasty worries about people, the envoys will always be by the side.

The ground is covered with moss and bones, and the moon is as long as it was in ancient times. Wild flowers do not see pedestrians, and mountain birds have never known Guan officials. The old man took the envoy's car, but I know Guo Dan is not as good. Please remember the guests from outside the pass, and write more letters when you travel to Kansai."

The white grass grinds the sky, and the sand in the lake rushes to the boundless. Master Zuo Rongmu is as sharp as frost. A middle-aged soldier can't keep the article. Achievement must be timely, and there must be a body and a body. The man feels loyal and righteous, and forgets the hometown of Yue after thousands of miles. Meng Xia waited late, and the grass and trees in Hu State grew. The horse is faster than the bird, and the sky is poorer than the sunset. The guards are newly dispatched, and military uniforms will be issued in May. There are two million armored soldiers scattered with golden light. Raise the flag to blow Kunlun, beat the drum to shake Puchang. Taibai led the officers and soldiers, and Tianwei came to the wilderness. Looking west, the clouds are like snakes, and the barbarians know death. In the Qing Dynasty, Dawan horses were driven, and they were tied to King Loulan. I once went to Jiaohe City, and the customs broke my heart. Hanyi is as far away as a point, and Bianfeng looks at each other. There are many winds in the red pavilion, and the anger is irresistible. Sometimes no one walks, and sand and stones flutter. The night is quiet and the sky is depressed, with ghosts crying beside the road. There are many skulls on the ground, all of which are ancient battlefields. On the evening of setting wine in the high hall, the moon is dark in the border town. Fat cattle are slaughtered in the army, and wine cups are in the hall. Red tears and golden candle plates, charming songs and new makeup. Wangjun looks up to Qingming, and it is difficult to fly with a short heap. Cang Ran Xijiao Road, how generous is the handshake."

The prefect came to the mountain and the spring came out, and the people in the yellow sand moraine were farming. Huang Huang's old temples are bright, and he is willing to stay in the prefect for another five years. On the top of the city, the moon rises and the sky is full of stars, and Zhang Jinyan buys wine in Qufang. The beauty's red makeup is fresh, and the side hangs in a high bun with gold tins. Drunk sitting in front of a red candle with a hidden hook, I don't know where the hook is. With the coral whip in your hand, Wei Jun shoots half of the gold coins, and the pleasure has already been missed."
边塞,岑参,终南山双峰草堂作,唐,敛迹归山田，息心谢时辈。昼还草堂卧，但与双峰对。兴来恣佳游，事惬符胜槩。著书高窗下，日夕见城内。曩为世人误，遂负平生爱。久与林壑辞，及来松杉大。偶兹近精庐，屡得名僧会。有时逐樵渔，尽日不冠带。崖口上新月，石门破苍霭。色向群木深，光摇一潭碎。缅怀郑生谷，颇忆严子濑。胜事犹可追，斯人邈千载。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Zhongnanshan Shuangfeng Thatched Cottage,"Gather traces and return to Yamada, rest assured and thank the generation. In the daytime, I still lie in the thatched cottage, but I am facing Shuangfeng. Xing Lai enjoys a good tour, and things are pleasant and satisfying. Under the high window of the book, you can see the city day and night. In the past, I was wronged by the world, so I lost the love of my life. For a long time, I said goodbye to Linhe, and came to Songshan University. I'm close to Jinglu, and I have won many famous monks' associations. Sometimes chasing woodcutters and fishing, all day without a crown. The new moon is on the cliff mouth, and the stone gate is breaking through the mist. The color is deep towards the group of trees, and the light shakes and shatters. Remembering Zheng Shenggu, I recall Yan Zise. Victory can still be pursued, and the people of Sri Lanka have lived for thousands of years."
边塞,岑参,终南云际精舍寻法澄上人不遇归高冠东潭石淙望秦岭微雨作贻友人,唐,昨夜云际宿，旦从西峰回。不见林中僧，微雨潭上来。诸峰皆青翠，秦岭独不开。石鼓有时鸣，秦王安在哉。东南云开处，突兀猕猴台。崖口悬瀑流，半空白皑皑。喷壁四时雨，傍村终日雷。北瞻长安道，日夕生尘埃。若访张仲蔚，衡门满蒿莱。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,"At the end of the Yunji Abode in the south, I searched for the Dharma Cheng, but I didn’t return to Gaoguan, Dongtan, and the rocks. Looking at the light rain on the Qinling Mountains, I am a friend.","Last night, I stayed in the clouds and returned from West Peak once. There is no monk in the forest, and the light rain comes up from the pool. All the peaks are verdant, but the Qinling Mountains are inseparable. The stone drum sometimes sounds, and the king of Qin is safe. In the southeast cloud, there is a macaque platform abruptly. There is a waterfall hanging at the mouth of the cliff, and it is half blank. It rains four o'clock on the wall, and the village is surrounded by thunder all day long. Looking north to Chang'an Road, dust is born day and night. If you visit Zhang Zhongwei, Hengmen is full of Artemisia Lai."
边塞,岑参,经火山,唐,火山今始见，突兀蒲昌东。赤焰烧虏云，炎氛蒸塞空。不知阴阳炭，何独然此中。我来严冬时，山下多炎风。人马尽汗流，孰知造化功。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,via volcano,"The volcano is only now seen, abruptly east of Puchang. The red flame burns the cloud, and the flaming atmosphere steams and fills the air. If you don't know the yin and yang charcoal, how can you be alone in it.

边塞,岑参,范公丛竹歌,唐,世人见竹不解爱，知君种竹府城内。此君托根幸得地，种来几时闻已大。盛暑翛翛丛色寒，闲宵槭槭叶声乾。能清案牍帘下见，宜对琴书窗外看。为君成阴将蔽日，迸笋穿阶踏还出。守节偏凌御史霜，虚心愿比郎官笔。君莫爱南山松树枝，竹色四时也不移。寒天草木黄落尽，犹自青青君始知。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Fan Gong Cong Bamboo Song,"People in the world can't understand love when they see bamboo, but they know that you plant bamboo in the city. This Jun Tuogen is fortunate to have planted it, and it has been heard a lot since it was planted. In the hot summer, the color of the clusters is cold, and the sound of maple leaves is dry in the idle night. If you can clear the case and see it under the curtain, you should look out the window of the piano book. For the king, the yin will block out the sun, and the bamboo shoots will come out through the steps. Observing the festival favors Ling Yushishuang, and humbly wishes to compare Lang's official pen. Jun Mo loves the branches of Nanshan pine, and the color of bamboo does not change in all seasons. In the cold weather, the grass and trees are all yellow and fallen, and I still know it since Lord Qingqing."

Yu Shu visited Quli last night, and Shan Yu was already in Jinshanxi. Looking west from the Shulou, the smoke and dust are black, and the Han soldiers are stationed in Luntai. Admiral Yongyao set off to the west, and marched in Pingming playing the flute. Drums beating on all sides, the snow and the sea surged, and the three armies shouted that the mountains were moving. The soldiers of the captives are in the clouds, and the bones of the battlefield are wrapped around the grass roots. The Jianhe River is windy and snowy, and the sand mouth is frozen and the horseshoes are off. King Yaxiangqin has worked hard and hard, and vowed to repay the Lord Jingbianchen. Who has not seen the ancient history, but now sees the ancients who have made great achievements and famous places."

The rushing waves vibrate the stone wall, and the peak seems to be shaking. In September, the reed flowers are new, which makes the guests anxious. Whoever reads Jiangdao has old friends all over the world. There is no place to open your mind, and you can get rid of worries when you are drunk. Traveling to and from Bashan Road, you can see autumn grass sculptures three times. Di Shengxin knew each other, and his talent soared to the sky. Compose poems to analyze good fortune, and enter the scene to create a storm. Sentencing a soldier with a pen, a soldier dare not be proud. After Jieyun Lianggong, he can still tune when he encounters a tripod. When parting from Shujing, the sound and dust are very lonely. When you see your master, don't sigh the hometown Guanyao."

The willow branches at Qingmen are ready to be broken, and there are few people on the roadside in a day. There are endless roads out of Qingmen in the east, and the post building and official tree are in the east of Baling. Flowers rushing to Zhengyi seem to be embroidered, and clouds go with horses and horses are suspicious. Orchid wine is long before noon, and the wine in a silk rope jade vat is like milk. The fallen flowers in Batou have no horseshoes, and the flowers turned into mud in the light rain last night. The oriole's wings are wet and fly low, and the Kanto ruler is drunk and lazy. For a moment, Wang Jun was invisible, and he swung his whip and flew like an arrow. If you ask when the emissary will come, don't fly to the east and fly to the west."

Abandoned his official position for two years, cut his hair and returned to Yicheng. Clear mind and body, clean thoughts and happy emptiness. Famous incense pans through the windows, and the quiet chime is clear at dawn. In previous years, it was Zuo Erting who fought with a sword. Yu Yanjiu joined the army, and also re-discussed soldiers. The world is still unknown, but the Son of Heaven wishes to meet. From Qinglianyu in the morning, into the White Tiger Palace in the evening. The maid holds the tin stick, and the incense burner is brought out at the royal feast. Discuss the opening of the Tibetan scriptures, and discuss the frontier and poor formation diagrams. Forget the machine and tire of the noise, wandering to the river and sea. Si Shi can visit, but Hui Yuanfeng is still there. Once I fly tin away, when will I return it with the bowl. The smoke of the lake is cold to Wumen, and the Huaiyue is in the name of Chushan. A body like floating clouds, thousands of miles across the river. Lovesickness is at the end of the day, and looking south is endless."

When it rains and snows in the middle of the town, people from across the east of the river are envious. In the capital of Ye, we can only see the hills in ancient times, and the Zhangshui still flows like the old days. Looking at the countryside from the city should not be seen, it is too lazy to climb the building in the morning."

The stone forest is whistling, and suddenly it is between the windows. Whimpering and whimpering, the blue hair is gurgling. Acting Yang resents Chu Yun, false Xu Yunqiu smoke. It is suspected that it is also raining on the balcony, like miscellaneous Wushan apes. You can attract ghosts and gods to listen, and it will make your eyes and ears easy. Chu Ke was heartbroken, and Concubine Xiang was tearful. Whoever cuts the green tung branches will use Zhusi strings. It can contain the songs of the ancients and pass them on to the present.

The Jun family is near Qinhuai, facing Stone City. After ten years of self-study, he went to Beijing with a drum. Youth Dengjia Branch, moving ground smells the name. The couch is all five marquises, making friends with all the heroes. In June, Sophora japonica flowers fly, and I suddenly think of water shield soup. Cross the horse and go abroad, Danyang returns to Chaijing. Chu Yun leads back to the sail, and the Huai River floats for passengers. When visiting relatives at home, it is honorable to start. All the villagers came to congratulate and greet them with wine. Looking at the North Gu Tower leisurely, drunk in the pavilion on the lake. The moon leaves from Haimen, and sees Mao Shanqing. In the past, it was an imperial state, but today it is fortunate that the world is flat. The Five Dynasties changed the world, and the sound of the river was empty for thousands of years. Xuanyuan told the talisman, and Dandong got its inscription. The emperor received the jade book, and the ministers Luo Tianting. The joy is thinner than the sun, and the auspicious light is penetrating. Running towards all nations, galloping to gather all spirits. Brother Wang was still exiled as an official, and Qiu Yunsheng was often seen. The isolated city leads to the back lake, the heart and the lake are clear. A county has no rhetoric, and sometimes opens the way. The yellow crane hangs its wings, lingers but screams. The lovesickness is invisible, and the female star is empty."
边塞,岑参,送许拾遗恩归江宁拜亲,唐,诏书下青琐，驷马还吴洲。束帛仍赐衣，恩波涨沧流。微禄将及亲，向家非远游。看君五斗米，不谢万户侯。适出西掖垣，如到南徐州。归心望海日，乡梦登江楼。大江盘金陵，诸山横石头。枫树隐茅屋，橘林系渔舟。种药疏故畦，钓鱼垂旧钩。对月京口夕，观涛海门秋。天子怜谏官，论事不可休。早来丹墀下，高驾无淹留。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Send Xu Suiyi back to Jiangning to worship relatives,"Qing Suo under the imperial edict, the four horses returned to Wuzhou. Shubo is still given clothes, Enbo rises Cangliu. Wei Lu will be with his relatives, and he will not travel far away to his family. Look at the king's five buckets of rice, thank you Wanhuhou. It is suitable to go out of Xiyeyuan, such as going to South Xuzhou. Returning to the heart and looking at the sea and the sun, the dream of the country ascends the river tower. The big river pans Jinling, and the mountains cross stones. Maple trees hide huts, and orange groves line fishing boats. Planting medicines and sparse old borders, fishing with old hooks. On the evening of Jingkou on the moon, Guantao Haimen is in autumn. The emperor pities the officials and cannot stop discussing matters. Come early and go down under Danchi, and stay high without drowning."
边塞,岑参,送张秘书充刘相公通汴河判官便赴江外觐省,唐,前年见君时，见君正泥蟠。去年见君处，见君已风抟。朝趋赤墀前，高视青云端。新登麒麟阁，适脱獬豸冠。刘公领舟楫，汴水扬波澜。万里江海通，九州天地宽。昨夜动使星，今旦送征鞍。老亲在吴郡，令弟双同官。鲈鲙剩堪忆，莼羹殊可餐。既参幕中画，复展膝下欢。因送故人行，试歌行路难。何处路最难，最难在长安。长安多权贵，珂佩声珊珊。儒生直如弦，权贵不须干。斗酒取一醉，孤琴为君弹。临岐欲有赠，持以握中兰。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Send Secretary Zhang to act as Liu Xianggong to pass through the Bianhe judge and go to Jiangwai to visit the province,"When I saw you the year before last, I saw you were holding a pan of mud. I saw you at the place last year, and I saw that you were already in the wind. Going towards Chichi, looking high at the blue clouds. Newly climbed to the Qilin Pavilion, suitable for taking off the Haechi crown. Liu Gong led the boats, and the Bian River made waves. Thousands of miles of rivers and seas connect, Kyushu has a wide world. The star was used last night, and the saddle will be sent today. The old relative is in Wujun, and the younger brother is the same official. The leftovers of sea bass are worth remembering, and the soup of water shield is very delicious. Participate in the painting in the curtain, and re-exhibit the joy under the knees. It is difficult to try songs and travel because of sending off people. Where is the most difficult road, and the most difficult is Chang'an. There are many powerful people in Chang'an, and Ke Peisheng is Shanshan. Confucian scholars are as straight as a string, and the powerful don't need to do it. Fight wine to get drunk, and play the solitary piano for you. Linqi wants to have a gift, so he holds Zhonglan."
边塞,岑参,送张献心充副使归河西杂句,唐,将门子弟君独贤，一从受命常在边。未至三十已高位，腰间金印色赭然。前日承恩白虎殿，归来见者谁不羡。箧中赐衣十重馀，案上军书十二卷。看君谋智若有神，爱君词句皆清新。澄湖万顷深见底，清冰一片光照人。云中昨夜使星动，西门驿楼出相送。玉瓶素蚁腊酒香，金鞭白马紫游缰。花门南，燕支北，张掖城头云正黑，送君一去天外忆。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Sending Zhang Xianxin back to Hexi as a deputy envoy,"Jun Duxian, a disciple of Jiangmen, was always by his side as soon as he was ordered. Before reaching thirty, he was already in a high position, with a golden seal on his waist. The day before yesterday, Chengen Baihu Temple, who would not be envious of those who came back to see it. There are more than ten pieces of clothes in the trunk, and twelve volumes of military books on the case. If you look at your wisdom, if there is a god, the words and sentences of loving you are fresh. The bottom of Chenghu Lake is ten thousand hectares deep, and the clear ice shines on people. Last night, the clouds moved the stars, and Ximen Post House went out to see them off. The jade bottle is fragrant with plain ant wax and wine, and the golden whip and white horse are purple reins. To the south of Huamen, to the north of Yanzhi, and the city of Zhangye, the clouds are turning black."
边塞,岑参,送李副使赴碛西官车,唐,火山六月应更热，赤亭道口行人绝。知君惯度祁连城，岂能愁见轮台月。脱鞍暂入酒家垆，送君万里西击胡。功名祗向马上取，真是英雄一丈夫。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Send Deputy Envoy Li to Qixi in the official car,"The volcano should be even hotter in June, and there will be no pedestrians at the Chiting crossing. Zhijun is used to Qilian City, how can he worry about seeing the moon in Luntai. Take off the saddle and enter the restaurant for a while, send Jun Wanli west to hit Hu. Fame can only be obtained immediately, what a hero and husband."
边塞,岑参,送狄员外巡按西山军,唐,兵马守西山，中国非得计。不知何代策，空使蜀人弊。八州崖谷深，千里云雪闭。泉浇阁道滑，水冻绳桥脆。战士常苦饥，糗粮不相继。胡兵犹不归，空山积年岁。儒生识损益，言事皆审谛。狄子幕府郎，有谋必康济。胸中悬明镜，照耀无巨细。莫辞冒险艰，可以裨节制。相思江楼夕，愁见月澄霁。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Send Di Yuan to inspect the Xishan Army,"Soldiers and horses defending the Western Mountains, China must plan. I don't know what to do to countermeasures, so that the Shu people will be harmed. The cliffs and valleys in Bazhou are deep, and thousands of miles of clouds and snow are closed. The road in the spring pouring pavilion is slippery, and the rope bridge in frozen water is brittle. Soldiers are often hungry, and there is no continuous supply of embarrassing food. Hu Bing still hasn't returned, and the empty mountains are accumulating years. Confucian scholars know profit and loss, and judge everything they say. Di Zi, the shogunate man, will help if he has a plan. A bright mirror hangs in the chest, shining in every detail. Don't take risks and hardships, but you can benefit from temperance. Acacia Jianglou evening, worry about seeing the moon Chengji."
边塞,岑参,送祈乐归河东,唐,祁乐后来秀，挺身出河东。往年诣骊山，献赋温泉宫。天子不召见，挥鞭遂从戎。前月还长安，囊中金已空。有时忽乘兴，画出江上峰。床头苍梧云，帘下天台松。忽如高堂上，飒飒生清风。五月火云屯，气烧天地红。鸟且不敢飞，子行如转蓬。少华与首阳，隔河势争雄。新月河上出，清光满关中。置酒灞亭别，高歌披心胸。君到故山时，为谢五老翁。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Send prayer music back to the east of the river,"Qi Le showed off later and stepped out of Hedong. In previous years, I went to Lishan Mountain and dedicated to the Hot Spring Palace. The emperor didn't summon him, so he waved his whip and joined the army. I returned to Chang'an the month before last, and the money in my pocket was empty. Sometimes I take advantage of the excitement and draw Jiangshangfeng. Cang Wuyun at the head of the bed, pine trees under the curtain. Suddenly, like a high hall, there is a rustling breeze. In May, Huoyuntun, the sky and the earth are red. Birds don't dare to fly, and they move like a canopy. Shaohua and Shouyang are fighting for supremacy across the river. From the crescent river, clear light fills Guanzhong. Don't set up the Jiuba Pavilion, and sing loudly with a heart in mind. When you arrive at the old mountain, you will thank the five old men."
边塞,岑参,送费子归武昌,唐,汉阳归客悲秋草，旅舍叶飞愁不扫。秋来倍忆武昌鱼，梦着只在巴陵道。曾随上将过祁连，离家十年恒在边。剑锋可惜虚用尽，马蹄无事今已穿。知君开馆常爱客，樗蒱百金每一掷。平生有钱将与人，江上故园空四壁。吾观费子毛骨奇，广眉大口仍赤髭。看君失路尚如此，人生贵贱那得知。高秋八月归南楚，东门一壶聊出祖。路指凤皇山北云，衣沾鹦鹉洲边雨。勿叹蹉跎白发新，应须守道勿羞贫。男儿何必恋妻子，莫向江村老却人。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Send Feizi back to Wuchang,"The returnees from Hanyang mourn the autumn grass, and Ye Fei does not sweep away the inn. Qiu Lai recalled Wuchang fish, and dreamed that it was only in Baling Road. I once traveled to Qilian with the general, and stayed by the side for ten years after leaving home. It's a pity that the sword's edge is exhausted, and the horse's hoof has been worn out now. Zhijun opened a restaurant and often loves customers, every time he throws a hundred gold. If you have money in your life, you will give it to others, and the old garden on the river is empty. From my point of view, Feizi has strange hair and bones, wide eyebrows and big mouth, but still has a red mustache. Seeing that you lost your way, you will know the value of life. Gao Qiu returned to Southern Chu in August, and talked about his ancestors in a pot at the east gate. The road points to the northern clouds of Fenghuang Mountain, and the clothes are stained with rain on the edge of Yingwu Island. Don't lament wasted white hair and new hair, you should keep the way and don't be ashamed of the poor. Why should a man fall in love with his wife, don't be an old man in Jiangcun."
边塞,岑参,送郭乂杂言,唐,地上青草出，经冬今始归。博陵无近信，犹未换春衣。怜汝不忍别，送汝上酒楼。初行莫早发，且宿霸桥头。功名须及早，岁月莫虚掷。早年已工诗，近日兼注易。何时过东洛，早晚度盟津。朝歌城边柳亸地，邯郸道上花扑人。去年四月初，我正在河朔。曾上君家县北楼，楼上分明见恒岳。中山明府待君来，须计行程及早回。到家速觅长安使，待汝书封我自开。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Send Guo Yi Miscellaneous Words,"The grass grows on the ground, and it returns after winter. Boling has no recent letters, and he hasn't changed his spring clothes yet. I pity you and can't bear to say goodbye, so I send you to the restaurant. Do not start early on your first trip, and stay at the bridgehead. Fame must be achieved as soon as possible, and the years should not be wasted. In the early years, he worked on poetry, and recently he also annotated Yi. When to pass Dongluo, sooner or later you will go to Mengjin. On the side of Chaoge City, there are willows on the ground, and on Handan Road, flowers are rushing to people. In early April last year, I was in Heshuo. I once went to the north building of Junjia County, and I saw Hengyue clearly upstairs. Zhongshan Mingfu is waiting for you to come, and you must plan your schedule and return as soon as possible. When I get home, I will find the Chang'an envoy quickly, and I will open it myself when you seal the book."
边塞,岑参,送韩巽入都觐省便赴举,唐,槐叶苍苍柳叶黄，秋高八月天欲霜。青门百壶送韩侯，白云千里连嵩丘。北堂倚门望君忆，东归扇枕后秋色。洛阳才子能几人，明年桂枝是君得。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Send Han Xun into the capital of Jin Province and go to the examination,"The pagoda tree leaves are green and the willow leaves are yellow, and the autumn is high and the sky is frosty in August. A hundred pots from Qingmen are sent to Marquis Han, and white clouds connect thousands of miles to Songqiu. The north hall leans on the door to look at Jun Yi, and the east returns to the autumn scenery behind the fan pillow. How many talented people can there be in Luoyang, next year Guizhi will be yours."
边塞,岑参,送颜平原,唐,天子念黎庶，诏书换诸侯。仙郎授剖符，华省辍分忧。置酒会前殿，赐钱若山丘。天章降三光，圣泽该九州。吾兄镇河朔，拜命宣皇猷。驷马辞国门，一星东北流。夏云照银印，暑雨随行辀。赤笔仍在箧，炉香惹衣裘。此地邻东溟，孤城吊沧洲。海风掣金戟，道吏呼鸣驺。郊原北连燕，剽劫风未休。鱼盐隘里巷，桑柘盈田畴。为郡岂淹旬，政成应未秋。易俗去猛虎，化人似驯鸥。苍生已望君，黄霸宁久留。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Send Yan Plain,"The emperor read Li Shu, and the imperial edict was changed to the princes. Xianlang grants a talisman, and Huasheng stops to share his worries. Set up the front hall of the reception, and give money like a hill. Tianzhang descends three lights, and Shengze belongs to Kyushu. My brother town Heshuo, worship Xuan Huangyou. Sima leaves the gate of the country, and a star flows northeast. Xia Yun shines on the silver seal, accompanied by the summer rain. The red pen is still in the box, and the incense burns the clothes. This place is adjacent to Dongming, and the isolated city hangs Cangzhou. The sea breeze flicks the golden halberd, and the Taoist officials call out the Zou. In the northern suburbs of Yanyan, plagiarism has not stopped. Yuyan Aili Alley, Sang Zhe Ying Tianchou. How can it be flooded for ten days for the county, and the political success should not be autumn. Yisu goes to the fierce tiger, and turns a man into a gull. The common people have looked forward to the king, Huang Ba would rather stay for a long time."
边塞,岑参,送魏升卿擢第归东都因怀魏校书陆浑乔潭,唐,井上桐叶雨，灞亭卷秋风。故人适战胜，匹马归山东。问君今年三十几，能使香名满人耳。君不见三峰直上五千仞，见君文章亦如此。如君兄弟天下稀，雄辞健笔皆若飞。将军金印亸紫绶，御史铁冠重绣衣。乔生作尉别来久，因君为问平安否。魏侯校理复何如，前日人来不得书。陆浑山下佳可赏，蓬阁闲时日应往。自料青云未有期，谁知白发偏能长。垆头青丝白玉瓶，别时相顾酒如倾。摇鞭举袂忽不见，千树万树空蝉鸣。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Send Wei Shengqing to the East Capital because he is pregnant with Wei's school secretary Lu Hun Qiaotan,"Inoue tung leaves rain, and the Ba Pavilion rolls in the autumn wind. The old man was defeated, and the horse returned to Shandong. Wenjun is in his thirties this year, and he can make incense famous. You don't see the three peaks going straight up to five thousand feet, and the same is true when you see your article. Rujun brothers are rare in the world, and the strong words and strong pens are like flying. The general has a gold seal and a purple ribbon, and the censor has an iron crown and embroidered clothes. Qiao Sheng has not been a lieutenant for a long time, because the king asked if he was safe. How about Wei Hou's school theory? People came the day before yesterday and couldn't read it. At the foot of Luhun Mountain, there are good things to enjoy, and Peng Pavilion should go there in your free time. Since Qingyun is not expected, who knows that white hair can grow. The white jade bottle with the loess' head and green silk, looks like pouring wine when you don't look at each other. Shaking the whip and raising the coat of arms, suddenly disappearing, thousands of trees and cicadas singing in the sky."
边塞,岑参,送魏四落第还乡,唐,东归不称意，客舍戴胜鸣。腊酒饮未尽，春衫缝已成。长安柳枝春欲来，洛阳梨花在前开。魏侯池馆今尚在，犹有太师歌舞台。君家盛德岂徒然，时人注意在吾贤。莫令别后无佳句，祗向垆头空醉眠。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Send Wei Si back home,"Returning to the east is not satisfactory, and the guest house is Dai Shengming. The wax wine has not been drunk, but the spring shirts have been sewn. The willow branches in Chang'an are coming in spring, and the pear blossoms in Luoyang are blooming ahead. The Weihou Chi Pavilion is still there today, and there is still a stage for Taishi singing. Is it in vain for the prosperity of the Jun family? People at that time pay attention to my sages. Mo Ling has no good words to say goodbye to, but only sleeps drunkenly in the air."
边塞,岑参,郡斋闲坐,唐,负郭无良田，屈身徇微禄。平生好疏旷，何事就羁束。幸曾趋丹墀，数得侍黄屋。故人尽荣宠，谁念此幽独。州县非宿心，云山欣满目。顷来废章句，终日披案牍。佐郡竟何成，自悲徒碌碌。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Sitting in Junzhai,"Bearing Guo Wuliangtian, bowing down and showing favoritism. I am so sparse in my life, and I will be restrained when I do anything. Fortunately, I once approached Danchi, and I was able to serve the Yellow House. The old man is honored and favored, who wants to be alone. The prefectures and counties are not the heart of the place, and Yunshan is full of joy. After a while, chapters and sentences were abolished, and case letters were covered all day long. Zuojun is so successful, he is sad and busy."
边塞,岑参,凉州馆中与诸判官夜集,唐,弯弯月出挂城头，城头月出照梁州。凉州七里十万家，胡人半解弹琵琶。琵琶一曲肠堪断，风萧萧兮夜漫漫。河西幕中多故人，故人别来三五春。花门楼前见秋草，岂能贫贱相看老。一生大笑能几回，斗酒相逢须醉倒。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Night Gathering with Judges in the Liangzhou Pavilion,"The crescent moon rises from the top of the city, and the moon rises from the top of the city to illuminate Liangzhou. There are hundreds of thousands of houses in Qili of Liangzhou, and the barbarian half-plays the pipa. A pipa song can break my heart, the wind is rustling and the night is long. There are many old friends in the Hexi curtain, so don't come to the three or five springs. Seeing autumn grass in front of Huamen Tower, how can you look old when you are poor and humble. How many times can you laugh a lot in your life, and you must be drunk when you meet after a fight of wine."
边塞,岑参,峨眉东脚临江听猿怀二室旧庐,唐,峨眉烟翠新，昨夜秋雨洗。分明峰头树，倒插秋江底。久别二室间，图他五斗米。哀猿不可听，北客欲流涕。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Linjiang Tingyuanhuai Two-Room Old House at the East Foot of Emei,"Emei's smoke is green and new, washed by the autumn rain last night.

All the birds in the sea dare not fly, and among them are carps that are long and fat. The green grass on the shore never stops, and the white snow in the sky whirls away. The steaming sand flickers, the stones are like clouds, and the boiling waves fry the Hanyue. Yin fire submerges to burn the furnace of heaven and earth, why is it burning in the west corner. Shi Tunyue Cave invaded Taibai, and was angry with Akasaka Tongchanyu. Send you drunk Tianshan Guo, just seeing the sunset by the sea. Baitaishuang is terribly cold, and Atami's scorching air is thinner."
边塞,岑参,秦筝歌送外甥萧正归京,唐,汝不闻秦筝声最苦，五色缠弦十三柱。怨调慢声如欲语，一曲未终日移午。红亭水木不知暑，忽弹黄钟和白纻。清风飒来云不去，闻之酒醒泪如雨。汝归秦兮弹秦声，秦声悲兮聊送汝。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Qin Zhengge sent his nephew Xiao Zheng back to Beijing,"You don't hear the most bitter sound of Qin Zheng, with five-color winding strings and thirteen pillars. The tone of complaint is as slow as you want to speak, and the song does not move to noon all day long. The water and trees in the red pavilion don't know the heat, and suddenly play the yellow bell and white rice. The breeze comes and the clouds don't go away, and the wine wakes up with tears like rain. You return to Qin Xi and play Qin Sheng, and Qin Sheng chats with you sadly."

Thousands of peaks are covered with snow, and hundreds of miles are facing the city wall. The smoke sweeps across the clear sky, and the grass and trees reflect the morning light. There are hundreds of wells in the pass of chariots and horses, and there are two rivers in the valley. Yaxiang ascended the altar by himself, and the time was in danger. The prestige vibrates the barbarians, Huihua Zhong Huayang. Jingjie Luo Guangting, Ge collar cold autumn frost. The tiger warriors under the steps, the heron walks in the middle of the curtain. Today I suddenly boarded, and Gu En didn't look at his hometown. The confidant has not yet been reported, and the temples are rustling. It is difficult to know the fate of the time, and the achievements are not temporarily forgotten. The cicadas sing at the evening of the autumn city, and the birds go to the river and the sky. Soldiers and horses rest in war, and the wind and dust are still vast. Who should join hands together depends on Dong Guanlang."

In the middle age, he is a little official, so he makes his heart appreciate it. As well as Zizuo Mountain County, it is no different from finding a secluded habitat. Small officials tend to the bamboo path, and the court invades the medicine border. Hu Chen dark river Luo, Ershan shaking drums. The old man Zuo Rongxuan and Yi He Ling Yunni. Marching in Hangu, I heard the warbler cry twice. Looking at the red flag, drinking is low day by day. Hearing that the king wants to go up to the sky, the four horses neigh at the road. Looking up at floating and sinking, suddenly like cloud and mud. Sleeping in the post house at night, Xiaofa closes the city chicken. Melancholy at dusk in the western suburbs, the township book is inscribed on the king."

Zhijun wants to pay homage to the emperor, and horses and horses go to the Western Zhou Dynasty. How easy it is to be free, the beautiful voice is really romantic. To learn rich and clear Ci, you can't stop writing. The Jun family is He Sheng, and He Yi is hard to be a partner. Four or five uncles were princes at the same time. Recalling the value of yesterday, the value of Junke Beiqiu. Look at each other and go to Jizhou hand in hand. The day before yesterday in Nan County, I went up to the North Tower with you. There are no mountains in the wilderness, and the grass heads are setting in the white. The pear blossoms in the guest house are numerous, and the deep flowers are hidden in the sound of doves. The new wine is ripe in the south, and there is a woman who plays the harp. Drunk or singing wildly, drunk and full of worries. If the owner doesn't know each other, it's hard to stay here. My hut will eventually go south, worthy of traveling with the king and grandson. Why should you be willing to find each other? Get on a lonely boat."

边塞,岑参,故仆射裴公挽歌三首,唐,盛德资邦杰，嘉谟作世程。门瞻驷马贵，时仰八龙名。罢市秦人送，还乡绛老迎。莫埋丞相印，留着付玄成。五府瞻高位，三台丧大贤。礼容还故绛，宠赠冠新田。气歇汾阴鼎，魂飞京兆阡。先时剑已没，陇树久苍然。富贵徒言久，乡闾殁后归。锦衣都未着，丹旐忽先飞。哀挽辞秦塞，悲笳出帝畿。遥知九原上，渐觉吊人稀。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,The old servant shoots three elegiac songs of Pei Gong,"Shengde Zibangjie, Jiamo as the world. The gate looks at the horses and horses, and the name of the eight dragons is admired at the time. The Qin people who stopped the city sent it off, and returned home to welcome Jiang Lao. Don't bury the prime minister's seal, but keep Fu Xuancheng. The five houses look forward to the high position, and the three houses mourn the great sages. The courtesy is returned to the old crimson, and the crown is bestowed on Xintian. The breath rests on the Fenyin tripod, and the soul flies to Jingzhaoqian. In the past, the sword was gone, and the long tree was long and pale. Wealth and honor are just words for a long time, and the hometown returns after death. Even without the brocade clothes on, Dan suddenly flew away. Sad to say goodbye to Qin Sai, sad to leave the emperor's body. Knowing Jiuyuan from afar, I gradually feel that people are rare."

Chang'an is not the old days, Jingzhao is the new Qian. Huang Baguan is still aggrieved, and the common people hope that they have been wronged. Only Yu Qingyue is here, staying with Du Lingxuan. Out of Gujiao City, Guo Waixin in the tomb. Yu Suisi prefect, Yun Cong sent his wife off. Two swords are buried in Artemisia, and the pine gate is closed forever. Looking back at the North Hall, the golden seal has become dusty. Reminiscing about the Mingguang Palace yesterday, I have inherited the grace of the Son of Heaven. The talisman was moved to the north, and the axe was awarded to lead the west gate. The grass welcomes the curtain of the army, and the cloud brushes the edge of the pavilion. So far, it has been heard that there are still dead souls outside Longwai. The long and clear waves are wide, and the deep and deep buildings are deep. Bingxin often bandit seats, every act of righteousness spends money. Promote the peeping orchid room and recruit into Hanlin.

Only the remaining court clothes are still there, and the golden seal is dusty. Izumi households in the daytime, youth cover the night stage. The grass grows on the steps of the old hall, and the flowers bloom in the empty courtyard. In the evening of the mountain, the Mingjing goes, and the suburban cold ride blows back. It is difficult to see the three rivers, but Yu Gong should be cherished."
边塞,岑参,韩员外夫人清河县君崔氏挽歌二首,唐,令德当时重，高门举世推。从夫荣已绝，封邑宠难追。陌上人皆惜，花间鸟亦悲。仙郎看陇月，犹忆画眉时。遽闻伤别剑，忽复叹藏舟。灯冷泉中夜，衣寒地下秋。青松吊客泪，丹旐路人愁。徒有清河在，空悲逝水流。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,"Two Elegies of Mrs. Cui's Family in Qinghe County, Mrs. Han Yuanwai","At that time, Lingde was very important, and his high school was popular all over the world. My husband's glory is gone, and it's hard to catch up with the favor of the feudal city. Everyone in Moshang cherishes it, and so does the bird among the flowers. When Xianlang looked at Longyue, he still remembered when he was thrushing his eyebrows. Hearing of hurting the farewell sword suddenly, he sighed again about the Tibetan boat. The lamp is cold in the middle of the spring, and the clothes are cold in the autumn. The green pine hangs the tears of the guests, and the red pine makes the passers-by worry. There is only a clear river, and the water flows sadly."
边塞,岑参,山房春事二首,唐,风恬日暖荡春光，戏蝶游蜂乱入房。数枝门柳低衣桁，一片山花落笔床。梁园日暮乱飞鸦，极目萧条三两家。庭树不知人死尽，春来还发旧时花。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Two poems about spring in Shanfang,"The wind is calm and the sun is warm, and the spring is shining, and butterflies and bees come into the house indiscriminately.

The court tree doesn't know that people are dead, and the old flowers are still blooming in spring."
边塞,岑参,行军诗二首,唐,吾窃悲此生，四十幸未老。一朝逢世乱，终日不自保。胡兵夺长安，宫殿生野草。伤心五陵树，不见二京道。我皇在行军，兵马日浩浩。胡雏尚未灭，诸将恳征讨。昨闻咸阳败，杀戮净如扫。积尸若丘山，流血涨丰镐。干戈碍乡国，豺虎满城堡。村落皆无人，萧条空桑枣。儒生有长策，无处豁怀抱。块然伤时人，举首哭苍昊。早知逢世乱，少小谩读书。悔不学弯弓，向东射狂胡。偶从谏官列，谬向丹墀趋。未能匡吾君，虚作一丈夫。抚剑伤世路，哀歌泣良图。功业今已迟，览镜悲白须。平生抱忠义，不敢私微躯。,Frontier fortress,Cen Shen,Two Marching Poems,"secretly mourn this life, fortunately I am not old at forty. Once the world is chaotic, you can't protect yourself all day long. Hu Bing seized Chang'an, and weeds grew in the palace. Sad Wuling tree, no Erjing Road. My emperor is marching, and the soldiers and horses are magnificent day by day. Hu Chu has not yet been destroyed, and the generals are eager to conquer. Yesterday I heard that Xianyang was defeated, and the slaughter was as clean as sweeping. The corpses piled up like hills, and the blood swelled. Fighting against the country, jackals and tigers filled the castle. There is no one in the village, and the depression is empty. Confucian scholars have long-term strategies, but there is nowhere to embrace them. Huan Ran hurt the person at the time, raised his head and cried Cang Hao. If I knew that the world was in turmoil, I would study at a young age. Regret not to learn how to bend the bow, and shoot the wild beard eastward. Even from the admonishment official list, the fallacy tends to Dan Chi. If you can't get my lord back, you will pretend to be a husband. Touching the sword hurts the world, mourning songs and weeping for good pictures. It's too late for merit, and the mirror is sad with white beard. I have been loyal and righteous all my life, and I dare not be private."

The emperor opened Lin Pavilion in advance to wait, but now who counts the second master's work. The officers and soldiers left Loulan in the west, and the camp was near the cold moon cave. Xiaoshuang freezes the tail of the sword in Puhai, and snow falls on the pole at night on the onion mountain. When the moon falls, drums and horns sound at the gate, and thousands of people bound out of Fancheng. Washing soldiers and fish sea clouds meet the battle, and horses and dragons pile up the moon to shine on the camp. When the Fan army saw Han's camp in the distance, the valleys and mountains were full of crying. Thousands of arrows and thousands of knives were killed overnight, and the empty city was soaked in blood in plain sight. Evening rain and flags are still wet, and the sun is cold with white grass and dust. Last night, General Lian Xiao fought, and the Fan army saw only horses with empty saddles."

Fifteen battles against the frontier, three times to challenge Loulan. Year after year, he has not been disarmed, and he has nothing to eat for a long time. The general surrendered to the Xiongnu, and the national envoy did not have Sanggan. When I went there, I paid 300,000 yuan and returned to Chang'an alone. If you don't believe in the bitterness of the battlefield, look at the scars of swords and arrows. The folks are all scattered, and the tombs are also destroyed. Climbing up the green pine branches, mourning the heart. Animals are sad, no one can bear to watch by the roadside. Fortunately, in the Ming Dynasty, the world was quiet and turbulent.

Seeing the ancient colors, there is quite a lot of freedom. Always stay away from the world, and return the energy to the grass and trees. There is no reason for surplus and shrinkage, so why worry about the past. The mountains in Chentu are high, and the elderly are like Zhongzhou. Who is talking about the fall, how can it be entertaining officials? The Yinhuo lay down in the past, and the cinnabar will plot against you. Yesterday, I came to Sudanjing and asked Hengyang again.

The sound is long outside Chu Mountain, and the song is deep around Huguan. Thousands of miles away, the heart of this night is spread far away. There are only a few lakes in the cold, and the sound is only in the secluded forest. I don't know who's son is playing Handan tone again.

The wind is still, the tide is full at night, and the city is high and cold. How lonely the old man is, he has been obedient and clear for a long time. Mingfa can't sleep, Tuying Jiang Shangzun."
边塞,王昌龄,宿裴氏山庄,唐,苍苍竹林暮，吾亦知所投。静坐山斋月，清溪闻远流。西峰下微雨，向晓白云收。遂解尘中组，终南春可游。,Frontier fortress,Wang Changling,Su Pei's Villa,"Cangcang bamboo forest at dusk, I also know what to vote for. Sitting quietly on the mountain during Ramadan, the clear stream can be heard far away. It rained lightly on the west peak, and collected it from Xiaobaiyun.

边塞,王昌龄,宿灞上寄侍御玙弟,唐,独饮灞上亭，寒山青门外。长云骤落日，桑枣寂已晦。古人驱驰者，宿此凡几代。佐邑由东南，岂不知进退。吾宗秉全璞，楚得璆琳最。茅山就一徵，柏署起三载。道契非物理，神交无留碍。知我沧溟心，脱略腐儒辈。孟冬銮舆出，阳谷群臣会。半夜驰道喧，五侯拥轩盖。是时燕齐客，献术蓬瀛内。甚悦我皇心，得与王母对。贱臣欲干谒，稽首期殒碎。哲弟感我情，问易穷否泰。良马足尚踠，宝刀光未淬。昨闻羽书飞，兵气连朔塞。诸将多失律，庙堂始追悔。安能召书生，愿得论要害。戎夷非草木，侵逐使狼狈。虽有屠城功，亦有降虏辈。兵粮如山积，恩泽如雨霈。羸卒不可兴，碛地无足爱。若用匹夫策，坐令军围溃。不费黄金资，宁求白璧赉。明主忧既远，边事亦可大。荷宠务推诚，离言深慷慨。霜摇直指草，烛引明光佩。公论日夕阻，朝廷蹉跎会。孤城海门月，万里流光带。不应百尺松，空老钟山霭。,Frontier fortress,Wang Changling,Su Bashang sent his servant Yuyu brother,"Drinking alone in Bashang Pavilion, outside the cold mountain and green gate. The long clouds suddenly set in the sun, and the mulberry jujube was already dark. Those who drove the ancients lived here for several generations. Zuoyi is from the southeast, so he doesn't know how to advance and retreat. My Zong Bing Quan Pu, Chu De Ke Lin the most. Maoshan was conquered once, and Baishu was raised for three years. Dao deeds are not physical, and there is no hindrance to spiritual friendship. Knowing my deep heart, I will get rid of the rotten Confucian generations. Meng Dongluan came out, and the ministers of Yanggu met. In the middle of the night, the road is noisy, and the five princes embrace the roof. It's time for Yan Qi's guest to offer his skills in Pengying. I am very pleased with my emperor's heart, and I have to face the queen mother. The humble minister wanted to pay homage, and the first phase of the Jishou period was destroyed. Brother Zhe felt my affection and asked Yiqiong if he was Thai. A good horse is still heeled, and a precious sword is not yet quenched. Yesterday I heard that Yu Shufei was flying, and the soldiers were full of energy. Many generals lost their discipline, and the temple began to regret it. An Neng called scholars, willing to discuss the key points. Rong barbarians are not grass and trees, and they are invaded and chased to embarrass them. Although there are achievements in massacring the city, there are also descendants of captives. Soldiers and rations are like mountains, and favors are like rain. There is no prosperity for the poor, and there is no love in the moraine land. If you use the individual strategy, the army will be surrounded and defeated. Don't spend gold, I would rather ask for white jade. The Lord of the Ming Dynasty is worried about the distance, but the frontier affairs can also be big. The lotus pets are sincere, and the words are deep and generous. The frost shakes pointing directly at the grass, and the candle guides the bright light. Public opinion is blocked day and night, and the court is wasted. The lonely city of Haimen is full of moonlight, thousands of miles away. It should not be a hundred feet of pine, empty and old Zhongshan mist."
边塞,王昌龄,就道士问周易参同契,唐,仙人骑白鹿，发短耳何长。时余采菖蒲，忽见嵩之阳。稽首求丹经，乃出怀中方。披读了不悟，归来问嵇康。嗟余无道骨，发我入太行。,Frontier fortress,Wang Changling,About Taoist Priests Ask Zhou Yi to participate in the contract,"The immortal rides a white deer, with short hair and long ears.

Sigh, I have no bones, send me into Taihang."
边塞,王昌龄,悲哉行,唐,勿听白头吟，人间易忧怨。若非沧浪子，安得从所愿。北上太行山，临风阅吹万。长云数千里，倏忽还肤寸。观其微灭时，精意莫能论。百年不容息，是处生意蔓。始悟海上人，辞君永飞遁。,Frontier fortress,Wang Changling,sad line,"Don't listen to the white-headed chants, the world is easy to worry and complain. If it weren't for the prodigal son, An De would do what he wanted. Go north to the Taihang Mountains, and read the thousands of winds. The long clouds are thousands of miles away, and they suddenly return to the skin. When watching its extinction, the essence cannot be discussed. There is no rest for a hundred years, and it is a business vine. When I first realized the people of the sea, I resigned from the king and flew away forever."

Shan Zun is in a fishing boat, and Zhao Yue is already drunk. Beginning to be poor and clear the source of the mouth, the ravine is absolutely different. The spring spring drips down the empty cliff, and the sprouting grass demolishes the shade. The wind has been silent for a long time, and the sound of woodcutters is heard from afar. When the sea geese fly alone, they will always be in Cangzhou. In ancient times, Qingming guest, Mieji became a lieutenant. My son is hesitant, it's so complicated. Goufeng believes what is overcome, and Yu Naisui in Jibei. The meaning of Qiwu has been understood, but the reason for resting shoulders has not yet been realized. The shape of the volume is comfortable, and it is a little off from the opinions of sages. Mid-month scarf, rice monk Songyang Temple."

边塞,王昌龄,箜篌引,唐,卢溪郡南夜泊舟，夜闻两岸羌戎讴。其时月黑猿啾啾，微雨沾衣令人愁。有一迁客登高楼，不言不寐弹箜篌。弹作蓟门桑叶秋，风沙飒飒青冢头。将军铁骢汗血流，深入匈奴战未休。黄旗一点兵马收，乱杀胡人积如丘。疮病驱来配边州，仍披漠北羔羊裘。颜色饥枯掩面羞，眼眶泪滴深两眸。思还本乡食犛牛，欲语不得指咽喉。或有强壮能咿嚘，意说被他边将雠。五世属藩汉主留，碧毛毡帐河曲游。橐驼五万部落稠，敕赐飞凤金兜鍪。为君百战如过筹，静扫阴山无鸟投。家藏铁券特承优，黄金千斤不称求。九族分离作楚囚，深溪寂寞弦苦幽。草木悲感声飕飗，仆本东山为国忧。明光殿前论九畴，簏读兵书尽冥搜。为君掌上施权谋，洞晓山川无与俦。紫宸诏发远怀柔，摇笔飞霜如夺钩。鬼神不得知其由，怜爱苍生比蚍蜉。朔河屯兵须渐抽，尽遣降来拜御沟。便令海内休戈矛，何用班超定远侯，史臣书之得已不。,Frontier fortress,Wang Changling,Konghou Yin,"In the south of Luxi County, boats are moored at night, and Qiang Rong and Ou are heard on both sides of the bank at night. At that time, the moon black ape tweeted, and the light rain stained the clothes, making people worry. A migrant climbed a tall building and played the harp without saying that he could not sleep. Playing as Jimen mulberry leaves in autumn, the wind and sand rustling green tombs. General Tie Cong, sweating and bleeding, went deep into the Huns and continued to fight. The yellow flag collected a little bit of soldiers and horses, killing barbarians indiscriminately and accumulating like hills. Sore disease drove to Bianzhou, still wearing Mobei lamb fur. The color is hungry and shy, and the tears are deep in the eyes. Thinking of returning to my hometown to eat yaks, I want to speak without pointing to my throat. Or someone who is strong can babble, meaning to be captured by him. The fifth generation belonged to the vassal Han Dynasty, and stayed in the river with a green felt tent. The 50,000 camel tribes are thick, and the flying phoenix is bestowed with golden pockets. For the king, a hundred battles are like a plan, sweeping the shadowy mountains quietly and no birds cast. The iron coupons in the family are specially honored, and the gold is not worth asking for. The nine ethnic groups were separated and became prisoners of Chu, and the deep stream was lonely and bitter. The grass and trees are whistling with grief, and the servants are worried about the country. In front of the Mingguang Hall, discuss the Jiuchou, and read military books to search. To exercise power in the palm of the king, Dongxiao mountains and rivers have no companions. Zichen's imperial edict is far away and soft, and the frost flies like a hook when he shakes his pen. The ghosts and gods don't know the reason, and they love the common people more than the mayflies. Shuohe stationed troops must be withdrawn gradually, and all of them will be sent down to pay homage to Yugou. He ordered the people in the country to stop the spears, why use Banchao to Dingyuanhou, and Shichen's books were endless."

It was Xihong who came and sighed in the middle of the fast. Huai Zai looked at Nanpu, and it was almost midnight. But there is the sound of autumn water, worry makes the mind confused. What is a gift in the grasp, the Yaocao has faded away. When the scales of the sea are not melted, each is on the other side of the sky."

It's too early, thank you for returning now. Xiao Xiao is like Lingxu, and the waist belt disappears in an instant. The car suit suddenly came, and Cenyang was a wanderer.

Xuanmian does not care in vain, Qingchuan takes care of our door. In the sunset of the empty forest, the cold bird goes to the barren garden.

It is up to oneself to offend, and the nature is easy. The yellow leaves are chaotic in the autumn rain, and the empty fast is full of sorrow. Knowing the scriptures, the master has no trace of hard work. Fengqiao extends to the coast, and Kefan returns to Fuchun. The cold river reflects the village forest, and the pavilion is full of nobleness. The mausoleum is cold and vast, and when you ascend the city, you nostalgic for the past. The solitary smoke drags the long forest, and the spring water chats for a look. The mouth of the estuary preserves the guests from the south, and the sails enter the Qingjiang River. The migrants see each other off again, and the cicada changes its name in sorrow. The light rain is collected with the clouds, and it is misty to go to the mountains. When Haike flies alone, he will always be in Cangzhou. The panacea is identified day and night, the empty mountain pine and cinnamon. There are Huai County in the village, beside the trees of Changyan Creek. The green sweet-scented osmanthus is not spit out, and the qin is played alone in the river. Looking at the sea of fire when I return home, Chu Ye is under the autumn water."

I can't stop listening to the troubles and sorrows, and the high autumn moon shines on the Great Wall. The elm leaves in Guancheng are early and yellow, and the ancient battlefield is cloudy and sandy at dusk. Please return to the army to cover up the bones of the dust, and don't teach the soldiers to cry about the dragon. Qinghai Changyun dark snow mountain, the lonely city looks at Yumen Pass in the distance. The yellow sand wears the golden armor in a hundred battles, and it will not return until it breaks Loulan. The desert is dusty and the sun is dim, and the red flag is half rolled out of the gate. The former army has captured Tuyuhun alive in the night battle in Taohe. Hu Ping's shoulders are purple and sweaty, and the autumn moon is in the west of Broken Leaf City. The Ming emperor Xingchi sealed the sword, resigned from the king and took Loulan overnight. Yumen Mountain has thousands of peaks, and there are always beacons in the north and south of the mountain.

The jade pillow in the smoked cage has no color, and I lie down and listen to the long leak of Nangong. The autumn anvil in the high hall rings in the night, and the frost is deep, still remembering the coldness of the royal clothes. The silver lamp and green suit tailor rested, and looked at the Lord of Jincheng. Bong broom Ping Ming Golden Palace opened, temporarily put the round fan back together. The jade face is not as good as the color of a jackdaw, but it still brings the shadow of Zhaoyang sun. It's really hard to think about it for a long time, dreaming that the king feels suspicious. The fire shines on the west palace to know the night drink, and it is clear when the road is restored and the grace is given. The mid-autumn moon in Changxin Palace is bright, and His Royal Highness Zhaoyang is pounding clothes. There are traces of grass in the Bailu hall, and there is no feeling in the red tent."

Going out of the plug and entering the plug is cold, and there are yellow reeds everywhere. It has always been quiet and guests, and they are all dusty and old. Don't learn from knight-errants, but boast that Zi Liu is good. Drinking horses and crossing the autumn water, the water is cold and the wind is like a knife. The sun has not yet set in Pingsha, and I see Lintao gloomyly. In the old days of the Great Wall War, salty words were high-spirited. The yellow dust is full of ancient and modern times, and the white bones are in disorder. Fengzhao Ganquan Palace, the general conscript of soldiers from all over the world.

The fishing boat carries the fire far away, and the mountain chime emits lonely smoke. The clothes are blown outside the clouds and pine trees, and the door is clear by the river and Han. The peaks and mountains are low pillows, and the world meets the sky. Mist and flowers come out of fog, and stars shine in the river. Donglin Shuying is full, and I want to talk in melancholy."
边塞,李颀,寄万齐融,唐,名高不择仕，委世随虚舟。小邑常叹屈，故乡行可游。青枫半村户，香稻盈田畴。为政日清净，何人同海鸥。摇巾北林夕，把菊东山秋。对酒池云满，向家湖水流。岸阴止鸣鹄，山色映潜虬。靡靡俗中理，萧萧川上幽。昔年至吴郡，常隐临江楼。我有一书札，因之芳杜洲。,Frontier fortress,Li Qi,Send Wan Qirong,"If you are famous, you will not choose an official, and you will follow the boat in the world.

On the top of the lonely peak, you can see three flowers in spring every day. The white crane is in Cuiweili, and Huang Jing is on the shore of the secluded stream. Only then did I realize that the guests in the world are not as good as the people in the mountains. If the fairyland is in a dream, Chaoyun is like amiable. Seeing the color, why did he wave his hand to thank Fengchen."

The traveler is far away at night, and the owner's family is in autumn. Qiyi asked about the destiny, but wanted to travel in the mountains. Why do I have everything, the white clouds are empty and secluded. Depressed rivers and seas, see Danqiu day and night. Making troubles is not about fishing, but enjoyment goes and stays with you.

After farewell, it is like asking each other, Cangbo double white gulls."

Although there are mixed Cymbidiums, there is no time to compete for peaches and plums. Colleagues tend to go to the government for leisure, and the court period after sunset. The dense leaves are scattered with red spots, and the spirit strips are startled by purple rutabagas. Fangfei never gets tired of watching it, and would like to come here to pick it."

The Fuquan spring boils for several eyes, and the flat ground flows clear. The emperor worshiped the sacrificial ceremony, and the imperial edict regarded the Sangong. Separate officials prayed to the Ling Temple, and laid a biscuit to the Shenhe Palace. The spirit should be like a persimmon, and the pines and bamboos are verdant. Cang Chi sends flying rain, and Red Carp sprays back the wind. Sprinkle wine on the cloth Yao banquet, play the flute and play Yutong. Xuanming is in charge of Yin affairs, wishing Shi a good year. Hundreds of valleys tend to the bottom of the pool, and three lights hang in the mirror. Shallow and deep dew sand and stones, apple algae grow void. The evening scene is near Panmei, and Ting Gao is light and red. The clear mountains are surrounded by boats, and egrets are frightened by silk trees. I am originally from Yingbei, and I opened the door to see Weisong. How do you know that outside of Songfeng, there is the East of the Temple of Heaven. The left hand is touching the scorpion, and the song is full of blue sky. The barbarians are still proud of the officials, and they look up to the fishermen. In this regard, Kawakami is idle, not the same as the king. Shuangning is far from the village, and the moon is quiet and reeds. It's hard to meet in this situation, and it's not the end of joy. Drowned stay sad to say goodbye, Yanyu is dimly lit in the evening."

The spring breeze dissolves the sheaths and the rain moistens the roots, and a branch and a half of leaves clear the traces of dew. It's not enough to talk about being alone in all directions when you are facing the clouds in front of your face. Hold this feeling again and again as farewell, Songluo's old friend told him."
边塞,李颀,少室雪晴送王宁,唐,少室众峰几峰别，一峰晴见一峰雪。隔城半山连青松，素色峨峨千万重。过景斜临不可道，白云欲尽难为容。行人与我玩幽境，北风切切吹衣冷。惜别浮桥驻马时，举头试望南山岭。,Frontier fortress,Li Qi,Shaoshi Xueqing sends Wang Ning off,"Shaoshi and many peaks are separated from each other, one peak is clear and the other is snowy. There are green pines in the middle of the mountain across the city, and the plain colors are tens of thousands of high. The passing scenery is oblique and impassable, and the white clouds are too embarrassing to be exhausted. Pedestrians play with me in seclusion, and the north wind blows my clothes cold. When I bid farewell to the pontoon bridge stationed in the horse, I raised my head and tried to look at Nanshanling."

The neon lights shine on the unicorn car, and the peacock fan drips from the feather cover. Putting pears in your fingers and sending emperor's food can live long in Linyu County. He wears a nine-star crown on his head again, and Yutong, the commander-in-chief, sits to the south. If you want to hear the important words, I will tell you now, and the emperor will burn incense to ask for these words. If you can chain your soul to get rid of the three corpses, you will see me in the place of the emperor later. Gu said Dong Shuangcheng, a maid, can play clouds and sheng in the wine bar. Hongxia remained motionless during the day, and seven dragons and five phoenixes greeted her. It's a pity that Zhijiao is displeased, and he sighs for horseshoes and ruts. Fu Daoge Zhongyao will be dusk, peaches and plums in the deep palace will become snow. In order to see the five sapphire lamps, Pan Chi spit out the flames and was dying."
边塞,李颀,东京寄万楚,唐,濩落久无用，隐身甘采薇。仍闻薄宦者，还事田家衣。颍水日夜流，故人相见稀。春山不可望，黄鸟东南飞。濯足岂长往，一樽聊可依。了然潭上月，适我胸中机。在昔同门友，如今出处非。优游白虎殿，偃息青琐闱。且有荐君表，当看携手归。寄书不待面，兰茝空芳菲。,Frontier fortress,Li Qi,Send Wanchu from Tokyo,"It's useless for a long time, and Gan Caiwei hides. It is still heard that the eunuch is still in charge of Tian Jiayi. Yingshui flows day and night, and old friends rarely see each other. The spring mountain is out of sight, and the yellow bird flies southeast. How long does it take to wash your feet, a bottle of chat can be relied on. Knowing about the moon on the lake, it fits the machine in my chest. In the past, I was a friend of mine, but now I have a different origin. Enjoy the tour of the White Tiger Palace, and die in Qingsuowei. And if you have a recommendation table, you should look at returning hand in hand. Send a book without waiting for an interview, Lan Li is empty and Fangfei."
边塞,李颀,古意,唐,男儿事长征，少小幽燕客。赌胜马蹄下，由来轻七尺。杀人莫敢前，须如猬毛磔。黄云陇底白雪飞，未得报恩不能归。辽东小妇年十五，惯弹琵琶解歌舞。今为羌笛出塞声，使我三军泪如雨。,Frontier fortress,Li Qi,Old-fashioned,"Men do the Long March, and young and quiet Yankee. Gambling wins under the horse's hoof, because it is seven feet lighter. Before you dare to kill, you must be like a hedgehog's hair. Bai Xuefei at the bottom of Huang Yunlong can't return without repaying his kindness. A young woman in Liaodong is fifteen years old, and she is used to playing the pipa and singing and dancing. Today, the sound of the Qiang flute makes our three armies cry like rain."
边塞,李颀,龙门西峰晓望刘十八不至,唐,春台临永路，跂足望行子。片片云触峰，离离鸟渡水。丛林远山上，霁景杂花里。不见携手人，下山采绿芷。,Frontier fortress,Li Qi,Longmen Xifeng Xiaowang Liu Shiba will not come,"Chuntai Linyong Road, looking forward to Xingzi.

Every time I hear the Langa Sutra, I only look at the clear emerald light. Hundreds of valleys gather the color of snow, and berry moss invades the beams of the house. The ancient wall of the gas plate turns, and the potential attracts the secluded steps. May you swim under the leaves of scorpion, and see the golden incense burner every day."
边塞,李颀,同张员外諲詶荅之作,唐,洛中高士日沈冥，手自灌园方带经。王湛床头见周易，长康传里好丹青。鹖冠葛屦无名位，博弈赋诗聊遣意。清言只到卫家儿，用笔能誇钟太尉。东篱二月种兰荪，穷巷人稀鸟雀喧。闻道郎官问生事，肯令鬓发老柴门。,Frontier fortress,Li Qi,Works by Zhang Yuanwai,"Luozhong Gaoshi was in deep meditation every day, and he brought scriptures from the irrigation garden. Wang Zhan saw Zhou Yi at the bedside, and Chang Kang's biography was good Danqing. He crowns and Ge Qi has no name, playing games, composing poems and chatting about thoughts. Qingyan only went to Wei's house, and he could praise Taiwei Zhong with his pen. Dongli planted orchid sun in February, and the poor alleys were sparsely populated by birds and birds. Hearing that Lang Guan asked about trouble, he was willing to make Lao Caimen with hair on his temples."
边塞,李颀,杂兴,唐,沈沈牛渚矶，旧说多灵怪。行人夜秉生犀烛，洞照洪深辟滂湃。乘车驾马往复旋，赤绂朱冠何伟然。波惊海若潜幽石，龙抱胡髯卧黑泉。水滨丈人曾有语，物或恶之当害汝。武昌妖梦果为灾，百代英威埋鬼府。青青兰艾本殊香，察见泉鱼固不祥。济水自清河自浊，周公大圣接舆狂。千年魑魅逢华表，九日茱萸作佩囊。善恶死生齐一贯，祗应斗酒任苍苍。,Frontier fortress,Li Qi,Miscellaneous,"Shen Shen Niu Zhuji, the old saying is full of ghosts. Pedestrians burn rhinoceros candles at night, and the cave shines brightly and deeply. Riding in a chariot and driving a horse back and forth, He Weiran with a red dress and a red crown. The waves startled the sea like diving into a secluded rock, and the dragon with a beard lying on a black spring. The father-in-law of the waterside once said that things or evil should harm you. Wuchang Yaomeng was a disaster, EMI Yingwei buried ghosts in the mansion. Qingqinglan Ai Benshuxiang observed that the fish in the spring were ominous. The Jishui flows from the Qinghe River to its own turbidity, and the Duke of Zhou and the Great Sage receive public opinion madness. The charm of the millennium meets the Chinese watch, and the nine-day dogwood is used as a saber. Good and evil are the same in life and death, and we should only fight wine and let the Cang Cang."
边塞,李颀,杂歌谣辞 郑樱桃歌,唐,石季龙，僭天禄。擅雄豪，美人姓郑名樱桃。樱桃美颜香且泽，娥娥侍寝专宫掖。后庭卷衣三万人，翠眉清镜不得亲。官军女骑一千匹，繁花照耀漳河春。织成花映红纶巾，红旗掣曳卤簿新。鸣鼙走马接飞鸟，铜驮琴瑟随去尘。凤阳重门如意馆，百尺金梯倚银汉。自言富贵不可量，女为公主男为王。赤花双簟珊瑚床，盘龙斗帐琥珀光。淫昏伪位神所恶，灭石者陵终不误。邺城苍苍白露微，世事翻覆黄云飞。,Frontier fortress,Li Qi,Miscellaneous Ballads and Songs of Zheng Cherry,"Shi Jilong, the emperor of Tianlu. Good at heroes, the beauty's surname is Zheng and her name is Cherry. The beauty of the cherries is fragrant and lustrous, and E'e serves the bedroom and specializes in the palace. There are 30,000 people in the backyard, with emerald eyebrows and clear mirrors. Officers and soldiers ride a thousand horses, and the flowers shine on Zhanghechun. Woven into a red scarf with flowers reflecting it, the red flag is flicked and dragged to make a new book. Singing cymbals and walking horses to pick up the birds, and the copper-loaded zithers go to the dust. Ruyi Pavilion, a double gate in Fengyang, has a hundred-foot golden ladder leaning against the silver Han. Self-proclaimed wealth is immeasurable, women are princesses and men are kings. A coral bed with red flowers and double mats, and a dragon tent with amber light. The mausoleum of those who destroy stones will not be missed. Yecheng is pale and dewy, and the world is turned upside down by Huang Yunfei."

边塞,李颀,杂曲歌辞 行路难,唐,汉家名臣杨德祖，四代五公享茅土。父子兄弟绾银黄，跃马鸣珂朝建章。火浣单衣绣方领，茱萸锦带玉盘囊。宾客填街复满座，片言出口生辉光。世人逐势争奔走，沥胆堕肝惟恐后。当时一顾登青云，自谓生死长随君。一朝谢病还乡里，穷巷苍苔绝知己。秋风落叶闭重门，昨日论交竟谁是。薄俗嗟嗟难重陈，深山麋鹿可为邻。鲁连所以蹈东海，古往今来称达人。,Frontier fortress,Li Qi,Miscellaneous Songs and Lyrics,"Yang Dezu, a famous minister of the Han Dynasty, shared the thatched land with four generations and five princes. The father and son brothers are silver and yellow, and the leaping horse Mingke is in charge of Jianzhang. Huo Huan single clothes embroidered square collar, cornel brocade with jade plate pouch. The streets were full of guests, and a few words radiated light. The people of the world are rushing to fight each other, and they are afraid of what will happen later. At that time, as soon as he climbed Qingyun, he said that life and death will always follow the king. Once I returned to my hometown after thanking my illness, the moss in the poor alleys was absolutely confidant. The autumn wind and fallen leaves close the door, and yesterday's discussion was about who is right. Thin vulgarity is hard to repeat, and the elk in the deep mountains can be neighbors. The reason why Lu Lian crossed the East China Sea has been called a master throughout the ages."
边塞,李颀,西亭即事,唐,桃李皆开尽，芳菲渐觉阑。鸟声愁暮雨，花色疑春寒。倚石攀藤蔓，窥林数竹竿。葛巾常半著，何处似当閒。,Frontier fortress,Li Qi,Xiting Jishi,"The peaches and plums are all in bloom, and Fangfei gradually feels exhausted. The sound of birds worries about the evening rain, and the color of flowers doubts the coldness of spring. Leaning on stones and climbing vines, peeking at the forest and counting bamboo poles. Gejin is often half-closed, where it seems to be idle."
边塞,李颀,别梁锽,唐,梁生倜傥心不羁，途穷气盖长安儿。回头转眄似雕鹗，有志飞鸣人岂知。虽云四十无禄位，曾与大军掌书记。抗辞请刃诛部曲，作色论兵犯二帅。一言不合龙额侯，击剑拂衣从此弃。朝朝饮酒黄公垆，脱帽露顶争叫呼。庭中犊鼻昔尝挂，怀里琅玕今在无。时人见子多落魄，共笑狂歌非远图。忽然遣跃紫骝马，还是昂藏一丈夫。洛阳城头晓霜白，层冰峨峨满川泽。但闻行路吟新诗，不叹举家无担石。莫言贫贱长可欺，覆篑成山当有时。莫言富归长可托，木槿朝看暮还落。不见古时塞上翁，倚伏由来任天作。去去沧波勿复陈，五湖三江愁杀人。,Frontier fortress,Li Qi,don't,"Liang Sheng is suave and uninhibited, and his poor life overwhelms Chang'an. Turning back and turning around like a carved osprey, no one knows if there is ambition. Although it is said that there is no salary in forty, he once held the secretary with the army. Resist the resignation, please kill the trilogy, and write about the two commanders of the soldiers and criminals. If a word disagrees with Long Erhou, Fencing Fuyi has since abandoned it. Huang Gonglu drank from morning to morning, took off his hat and exposed his head, and shouted loudly. The calf nose in the court used to be hung, but the Langgan in the bosom is gone now. At that time, people saw how down and out they were, and they laughed and sang wildly. Suddenly dispatched the Zi Liuma, who was still the husband of Ang Zang. The head of Luoyang city is frosty and white, and the ice layer is so high that it is full of rivers and lakes. But Wen Xinglu chanted new poems, and he didn't sigh that his family had no burden. Mo Yan's poor and lowly can be bullied, and it's time to fall into a mountain. Mo Yan's richness is trustworthy, and the hibiscus is still falling. I don't see the ancient fortress Weng, who leaned on the origin and let the sky make it. Go to Cangbo, don't return to Chen, five lakes and three rivers worry about killing people."
边塞,李颀,听安万善吹觱篥歌,唐,南山截竹为觱篥，此乐本自龟兹出。流传汉地曲转奇，凉州胡人为我吹。傍邻闻者多叹息，远客思乡皆泪垂。世人解听不解赏，长飙风中自来往。枯桑老柏寒飕飗，九雏鸣凤乱啾啾。龙吟虎啸一时发，万籁百泉相与秋。忽然更作渔阳掺，黄云萧条白日暗。变调如闻杨柳春，上林繁花照眼新。岁夜高堂列明烛，美酒一杯声一曲。,Frontier fortress,Li Qi,Listening to An Wanshan's song,"Nanshan cut bamboo to make it into 秱篥, and this music originally came from Kucha. It is circulated that the tunes of the Han Dynasty turned strange, and the Hu people of Liangzhou played it for me. Those who heard it from neighbors sighed a lot, and those from afar were weeping when they were homesick. People in the world don't understand the appreciation, and they come and go in the wind. Withered mulberry and old cypress chirping in the cold, Nine chicks singing and phoenix chirping chaotically. Dragons sing and tigers roar for a while, and all sounds and springs meet each other in autumn. Suddenly it becomes more mixed with Yuyang, Huangyun is depressed, the day is dark. The change of tone is like hearing the spring of willows, and the flowers in the forest are new. On New Year's Eve, there are candles in the high hall, and a glass of fine wine sounds a song."
边塞,李颀,听董大弹胡笳声兼寄语弄房给事,唐,蔡女昔造胡笳声，一弹一十有八拍。胡人落泪沾边草，汉使断肠对归客。古戍苍苍烽火寒，大荒沈沈飞雪白。先拂商弦后角羽，四郊秋叶惊摵摵。董夫子，通神明，深山窃听来妖精。言迟更速皆应手，将往复旋如有情。空山百鸟散还合，万里浮云阴且晴。嘶酸雏雁失群夜，断绝胡儿恋母声。川为净其波，鸟亦罢其鸣。乌孙部落家乡远，逻娑沙尘哀怨生。幽音变调忽飘洒，长风吹林雨堕瓦。迸泉飒飒飞木末，野鹿呦呦走堂下。长安城连东掖垣，凤凰池对青琐门。高才脱略名与利，日夕望君抱琴至。,Frontier fortress,Li Qi,Listening to the sound of Dong Da playing the Hujia and sending a message to the house,"Cai Nv used to make the sound of Hu Jia, and there were eight beats in one play. The Hu people wept and touched the grass, and the Han envoys were heartbroken to the returning guests. The ancient garrison was dark and the beacon fire was cold, and the wilderness was heavy and white. First brush the Shang strings and then the horn feathers, and the autumn leaves in the surrounding suburbs startled. Mr. Dong, who is a god, is a goblin who eavesdropped in the mountains. Words are late and fast, and they will be reciprocated as if they are affectionate. The empty mountains are scattered and the birds are still together, and the clouds are cloudy and sunny for thousands of miles. The sour young geese lost their flock in the night, and the voice of Hu'er's Oedipus was cut off. The river is to clean its waves, and the birds are also to sing. The hometown of the Wusun tribe is far away, and the love and dust are full of sorrow and complaints. The tone of the quiet voice changes suddenly, and the long wind blows the forest rain and falls the tiles. The spring rushes and the moss flies, and the wild deer walks down the hall. Chang'an City connects with East Yeyuan, and Phoenix Pond faces Qingsuo Gate. Gao Cai gets rid of fame and fortune, and hopes that the king will arrive with his piano day and night."

边塞,李颀,放歌行荅从弟墨卿,唐,小来好文耻学武，世上功名不解取。虽沾寸禄已后时，徒欲出身事明主。柏梁赋诗不及宴，长楸走马谁相数。敛迹俛眉心自甘，高歌击节声半苦。由是蹉跎一老夫，养鸡牧豕东城隅。空歌汉代萧相国，肯事霍家冯子都。徒尔当年声籍籍，滥作词林两京客。故人斗酒安陵桥，黄鸟春风洛阳陌。吾家令弟才不羁，五言破的人共推。兴来逸气若涛涌，千里长江归海时。别离短景何萧索，佳句相思能间作。举头遥望鲁阳山，木叶纷纷向人落。,Frontier fortress,Li Qi,Let's sing and walk from my younger brother Mo Qing,"Xiao Lai is fond of literature and ashamed of learning martial arts, and fame and fame in the world are hard to come by. Although Zhan Cunlu is late, I want to be born to know the Lord. Bai Liang's poems are not as good as the banquet, and whoever can count the long catalpa and the horse. Concentrating on the traces, the brows are content with themselves, and the singing is half bitter. So I wasted an old man, raising chickens and herding hogs in the east corner of the city. Xiao Xiangguo in the Han Dynasty was willing to serve Feng Zidu of the Huo family. In those days, Tuer's voice and nationality, he wrote lyrics indiscriminately for two Beijing guests. The old man fights wine at Anling bridge, the yellow bird spring breeze Luoyang Mo. My family makes my younger brother uninhibited, and those who break the five words all recommend it. Xinglai Yiqi is surging like a wave, when the Yangtze River returns to the sea for thousands of miles. How bleak is the short scene of parting, and a good sentence of lovesickness can be interspersed. Looking up at Luyang Mountain, the leaves are falling to people."
边塞,李颀,临别送张諲入蜀,唐,出门便为客，惘然悲徒御。四海维一身，茫茫欲何去？经山复历水，百恨将千虑。剑阁望梁州，是君断肠处。孤云伤客心，落日感君深。梦里蒹葭渚，天边橘柚林。蜀江流不测，蜀路险难寻。木有相思号，猿多愁苦音。莫向愚山隐，愚山地非近。故乡可归来，眼见芳菲尽。,Frontier fortress,Li Qi,Farewell to send Zhang Chi into Shu,"When you go out, you will be a guest, and you will be disappointed and sad. The four seas are all in one body, where do you want to go? After going through the mountains and going through the water, a hundred hates will cause a thousand worries. Jiange looks at Liangzhou, which is the place where the king is heartbroken. The lonely cloud hurts the heart of the guest, and the setting sun feels deeply. In the dream, Jianjiazhu, the orange and pomelo forest in the sky. The flow of the Shu River is unpredictable, and the road to Shu is difficult to find. There is no lovesickness number, and the ape has a sad voice. Don't hide from the stupid mountain, the stupid mountain is not close. I can return to my hometown, and see the beauty of the fragrance."
边塞,李颀,春送从叔游襄阳,唐,言别恨非一，弃置我宗英。向用五经笥，今为千里行。裹粮顾庭草，羸马诘朝鸣。斗酒对寒食，杂花宜晚晴。春衣采洲路，夜饮南阳城。客梦岘山晓，渔歌江水清。楚俗少相知，远游难称情。同人应馆谷，刺史在郊迎。只合侍丹扆，翻令辞上京。时方春欲暮，叹息向流莺。,Frontier fortress,Li Qi,Spring Sends Cong Shu to Xiangyang,"Don't hate Feiyi, abandon me Zongying. To use the five classics, today it is a journey of thousands of miles. Gu Tingcao is wrapped in grain, and the horse is called Chaoming. Fighting wine against cold food, mixed flowers should be fine in the evening. Caizhou Road in spring clothes, drinking in Nanyang City at night. The guest dreamed that the mountains were dawning, and the fisherman's songs and rivers were clear. Chu people seldom know each other, and it's hard to be affectionate when traveling far away. Colleagues should be in the hall valley, and the governor should welcome them in the suburbs. Only serve Dan Jian, and turn the order to go to Beijing. At that time, Fang's spring was about to go to dusk, and he sighed to Liu Ying."
边塞,李颀,相和歌辞 从军行,唐,白日登山望烽火，昏黄饮马傍交河。行人刁斗风砂暗，公主琵琶幽怨多。野营万里无城郭，雨雪纷纷连大漠。胡雁哀鸣夜夜飞，胡儿眼泪双双落。闻道玉门犹被遮，应将性命逐轻车。年年战骨埋荒外，空见蒲萄入汉家。,Frontier fortress,Li Qi,Xianghe Geci Marching in the Army,"Climbing the mountain to watch the beacon fire in the daytime, drinking horses and crossing the river in the twilight. Pedestrians fight against the wind and the sand is dark, and the princess's pipa has many grievances. There is no city for camping for thousands of miles, and the rain and snow continue to reach the desert. Hu Yan wailed and flew every night, and Hu'er burst into tears. I heard that the Yumen Gate is still covered, so I should chase my life away. Every year the bones of war are buried outside the wasteland, and it is empty to see grapes entering the Han family."
边塞,李颀,绝缨歌,唐,楚王宴客章华台，章华美人善歌舞。玉颜艳艳空相向，满堂目成不得语。红烛灭，芳酒阑，罗衣半醉春夜寒。绝缨解带一为欢，君王赦过不之罪。暗中珠翠鸣珊珊，宁爱贤，不爱色。青娥买死谁能识，果却一军全社稷。,Frontier fortress,Li Qi,Song of the Dead,"The king of Chu entertained Zhang Huatai, a beautiful woman who is good at singing and dancing. The jade face is beautiful and the sky is facing each other, and the whole room is speechless. The red candle is extinguished, the fragrant wine is in the dark, Luo Yi is half drunk and the spring night is cold. Untie the belt for joy, and the king forgives the sin of innocence. In the dark, Zhu Cui Ming Shan Shan, Ning Aixian, not sex. Who can know Qing'e's death, but the result is an army and the whole country."
边塞,李颀,荅高三十五留别便呈于十一,唐,累荐贤良皆不就，家近陈留访耆旧。韩康虽复在人间，王霸终思隐岩窦。清冷池水灌园蔬，万物沧江心澹如。妻子欢同五株柳，云山老对一床书。昨日公车见三事，明君赐衣遣为吏。怀章不使郡邸惊，待诏初从阙庭至。散诞由来自不羁，低头授职尔何为。故园壁挂乌纱帽，官舍尘生白接䍦。寄书寂寂于陵子，蓬蒿没身胡不仕。藜羹被褐环堵中，岁晚将贻故人耻。,Frontier fortress,Li Qi,"When you are thirty-five in the high school, you will leave and submit it on the eleventh","It is not enough to recommend virtuous and good men. My family is close to Chen and I stay to visit the elders. Although Han Kang returned to the world, Wang Ba finally thought of hiding in Yandou. The cold pool water irrigates the garden vegetables, and everything is as calm as the heart of the Cangjiang River. The wife is happy with the five willows, and Yunshan always reads the same bed. There were three incidents in the bus yesterday, and Mingjun gave him clothes and sent him to be an official. Huai Zhang did not surprise the county mansion, and arrived from Que Ting at the beginning of the imperial edict. The reason why Sansheng comes from being uninhibited, what should I do if I bow my head and give a job. Black gauze hats are hung on the walls of the hometown, and the dust in the official houses is white. Sending books is silent in Lingzi, Penghao is dead and Hu is not an official. The quinoa soup is blocked by the brown ring, which will bring shame to the old people at the end of the year."
边塞,李颀,送从弟游江淮兼谒鄱阳刘太守,唐,都门柳色朝朝新，念尔今为江上人。穆陵关带清风远，彭蠡湖连芳草春。泊舟借问西林寺，晓听猿声在山翠。浔阳北望鸿雁回，湓水东流客心醉。须知圣代举贤良，不使遗才滞一方。应见鄱阳虎符守，思归共指白云乡。,Frontier fortress,Li Qi,Sent off my younger brother to visit Jianghuai and paid homage to Liu Taishou of Poyang,"The willows in the capital are new, and Nianer is now a native of Jiangshang. Muling Pass brings the cool breeze far away, and Pengli Lake is connected with fragrant grass and spring. Bo Zhou asked Xilin Temple, Xiao listened to the sound of apes in Shancui. Looking at the swan geese in the north of Xunyang, the tourists in the water flowing in the east are fascinated. It should be known that the holy generation promotes the virtuous and good, and does not make the remaining talents stagnant. It should be seen that the Poyang tiger is guarding, and thinking about returning refers to Baiyun Township."
边塞,李颀,送王道士还山,唐,嵩阳道士餐柏实，居处三花对石室。心穷伏火阳精丹，口诵淮王万毕术。自言神诀不可求，我师闻之玄圃游。出入彤庭佩金印，承恩赫赫如王侯。双峰树下曾受业，应传肘后长生法。吾闻仙地多后身，安知不是具茨人。玉膏清泠瀑泉水，白云溪中日方此。后今不见数十年，鬓发颜容只如是。先生舍我欲何归，竹杖黄裳登翠微。当有岩前白蝙蝠，迎君日暮双来飞。,Frontier fortress,Li Qi,Send the Taoist priest back to the mountain,"Songyang Taoist eats Baishi and lives in a stone room opposite the three flowers. With a poor heart, put down the fire-yang essence, and recite the Huai Wang Wanbi technique. I said to myself that the magic formula cannot be found, and my teacher heard about it. Entering and exiting Tongting, wearing a golden seal, Cheng En is as powerful as a prince. Under the Shuangfeng tree, he had been employed, and he should pass on the method of longevity after the elbow. I heard that there are many descendants in the immortal land, but Anzhi is not from Juci. Yupao is clear and cool waterfall spring water, which is the place of China and Japan in Baiyun River. I haven't seen her for decades, but her temples and appearance are just like this. Where do you want to go if you give me up, Mr. Bamboo stick and yellow clothes climb Cuiwei. When there are white bats in front of the rock, welcome you to fly at sunset."
边塞,李颀,送司农崔丞,唐,黄鹂鸣官寺，香草色未已。同时皆省郎，而我独留此。维监太仓粟，常对府小史。清阴罗广庭，政事如流水。奉使往长安，今承朝野欢。宰臣应记识，明主必迁官。塞外貔将虎，池中鸳与鸾。词人洞箫赋，公子鵔䴊冠。邑里春方晚，昆明花欲阑。行行取高位，当使路傍看。,Frontier fortress,Li Qi,Send Si Nong Cui Cheng,"Oriole Mingguan Temple, the color of vanilla is not over. At the same time, they are all ministers, and I stay here alone. Taicang millet, the Wei supervisor, often has a small history of the government. In Qingyin Luoguangting, political affairs are like flowing water. He was sent to Chang'an by envoy, and now he is in charge of the royal family. The prime minister should remember that the Ming Lord must move his official position. Outside the Great Wall is the brave general and the tiger, and in the pond is the mandarin duck and the luan. The poet is Dongxiao Fu, and the son is the crown. Spring is late in Yili, and flowers are dying in Kunming. Take a high position when you walk, and watch from the side of the road."

Today, you are not satisfied, and you have failed Di Xiangchun. The mouth does not speak of gold and silk, but the heart is always bent and stretched. Ruan Gong only drank, and Tao Lingken was ashamed and poor. Yang envies the romantic land, and swims in the sea to accommodate people. Ling song is far away from five lakes, and eight laurel trees are neighbors. The blue bird welcomes the lonely pole, and the white cloud follows it. The tide follows the Mausoleum, and the moon reflects the new stone. If you can't escape fame and wealth, you should be among the gentry. Tingzhou Fang Duse, I advise you to fish temporarily."
边塞,李颀,送刘十,唐,三十不官亦不娶，时人焉识道高下。房中唯有老氏经，枥上空馀少游马。往来嵩华与函秦，放歌一曲前山春。西林独鹤引闲步，南涧飞泉清角巾。前年上书不得意，归卧东窗兀然醉。诸兄相继掌青史，第五之名齐骠骑。烹葵摘果告我行，落日夏云纵复横。闻道谢安掩口笑，知君不免为苍生。,Frontier fortress,Li Qi,send liu ten,"At thirty, neither an official nor a marriage, how can people know the superiority and inferiority of the time. There is only Lao Shi Jing in the room, and there are few free horses on the stables. Traveling between Songhua and Qinqin, sing a song of Qianshanchun. The lone crane in Xilin walks leisurely, and the flying spring in Nanjian clears the corner scarf. The year before last, I was not satisfied with the letter, and I was drunk when I returned to the east window. All the brothers took charge of Qing History one after another, and the fifth one was named Qi Huqi. Tell me to cook sunflowers and pick fruits, and the setting sun and summer clouds are vertical and horizontal. Hearing that Xie An covered his mouth and smiled, knowing the king is inevitable for the common people."

Twenty-two poems, only the king has a good name. She has a childlike face and fair skin, and her Pede is like Yaoqiong. The Xun family is very romantic, and the son of the Hu family is pure. It is not anyone's fault if you are talented. The grass in Luoyang is as green as spring, and the wandering son returns to the east to pay homage to relatives. The head of the Zhangshui bridge is worth singing geese, and there are few pedestrians in the north of Chaoge County. Parting and drinking, the heart promises each other, and the setting sun is half light in the green suburbs. Please ride a horse to look at Xiling, and pay homage to Wei Wu for me."

At the age of nine, he can belong to Wen, and he can visit Emperor Mingguang. According to the imperial edict, Chi Chi came down and worshiped as Tongzilang. Erlai moved repeatedly, and Wei Luoyang three times. There are twelve gates in Luoyang, and the official temple faces each other. Green pagoda trees are surrounded on all sides, and Lushui runs through the center. The hearing of the lawsuit will break the needle, and the general will be able to benefit from the material. Remarks are full of words, and there is nothing wrong with making a speech. At the end of the year, the wind and snow are dark, and the road in Qin Zhongchuan is long. Pedestrians drink wax wine and immediately wear morning frost. There is no need to ask about things, the hometown is cold and grassy. From now on, Mo Xiao is in Nongsang."

If Liu Houzhi's body is like this, the natural bone will naturally be more beautiful. Fame has spread for twenty years, and he has traveled thousands of miles with one step. The whole world is close to the prime minister's pavilion, but I love Yichuan water only. Getting rid of snobbery is like dust, and Xiaoao is just a person at the time. Wenxiong, who was a few years old in the new poem, wrote a letter to the Penglai Palace in the past. The lord of the Ming Dynasty pays homage to the officials at Qilin Pavilion, and sees Yutong with all his chariots and horses. An expert travels to and from Lushan Mountain, and a hermit travels to and from Zhang Changgong. Funan sugarcane is as sweet as honey, mixed with lychees and Longzhou oranges. Chixian's complex words are full of operas, and Baiyun Gufeng shines forever. Looking at the birds while holding the palm, and reciting Langa in the evening to the empty room. Once out of the Zai Fen River, the Ming government got off the car and the officials were idle. Sitting upright in the courtroom is even better, and Wu Xianshan is just a stone's throw away from the door. Men plowing and women weaving are benefited, and the wheat is ripe and the pheasants are singing and the autumn crops are growing. Next year, when the Nine Governments will discuss meritorious service, five developments and three campaigns will be here.

See you again in the morning and evening in Qingshan, neighing the horse and going out to miss the old hometown. How magnanimous is Chen Houli's body, his beard and tiger eyebrows are still big. Ten thousand volumes of books are stored in my belly, and I refuse to bow my head in the grass. Drinking wine at the east gate and drinking my cao, light-hearted and everything is futile. I don't know the day and night when I'm drunk, sometimes I look at the lone cloud. The waves of the long river are so dark that it is impossible to stop the boat at the mouth of the river. The tourists from Zheng State did not reach home, and Luoyang Xingzikong sighed. I heard that I knew a lot in the old forest, how was it yesterday and today when I was dismissed from office."

It's a pity that the lake and the sea have taught Penglai books. Foreign things are not the original intention, and this life is empty and empty. What I think about is fun, but I am far away from bicycles. The high road is bumpy, so friends are willing to brag. It is only said that Qing Suotai does not love Chengming Lu. Hundreds of miles are full of people, and there are few disputes and lawsuits. Holding the Lotus Sutra in his hand, he watched the flying birds off.

There is no end to the difference, but suddenly they face each other. The green forest is bright and bright, and the green peaks are faint. Yuanying Village is even more lost, and the lone crane comes to visit. It's a joy to meet each other in victory, but it's hard to visit in immortal travel. The old man is an official of Peking Opera, so he has more leisure time in everything. The room is painted with Mount Emei, with waves in Dongting.

The copper stove will burn and drink happily, and the stars will be white and white. The cold wind rolls the leaves to Hutuo, and the snow covers the ground sadly. In the lonely city, at sunset, you can see roosting birds, and immediately hear the songs of fishermen. In the Ming Dynasty, the East Road was in the hands of the king, and the next day was the beginning of the year. Knowing that I am lonely and have nothing to think about, I dare to hope that the county people will send cattle wine."

My lord feels the utmost virtue, and Mr. Xuan is delighted to come here. The Golden Hall of Shoulu is opened, and the Jade Hall of Qingzhai is closed. Shengge greets the head, and the feather tent is solemn and guarded. Willows are forbidden to hang down on the censer, and palace flowers brush the fairy sleeves. Pray for the prosperity of the New Year, and bring blessings to the common people. Why wait for the dragon's beard, the tripod is ready to get help."

The setting sun hangs the mountain ghost, and the returning wind blows the girl. The stone cliff opens to the west, leading to look at the Yellow River. Thousands of miles away, a bird is flying, and the lonely light is passing away. Driving on the city road, I feel melancholy about this rock."

On the twenty-eighth, the crescent combs the fallen horse, and the fine wine and clear songs are under the room. Brocade clothes were bestowed by Wenchang Palace, and Chang'an Moshang retreated to the court. Wuling guests dare not look down on them, and bureaucrats from the three provinces are rare.

Take a leisurely look at the savage rafts, or drink wine on the river. Youyun Dan wanders, and egrets fly around. The courtyard bamboo hangs down inside, and the village smoke is separated from Nanfu. When I first learned about the affair, the hairpin is the same as a humble dog."

The red carp rushes to Qin Gao, and the white tortoise walks to Feng Yi. The spirit is like a fairy, and they know each other from afar. In ancient times, there were people who ascended the heights, but how many people are there today. Cangzhou violated the promise, and tomorrow is still waiting. The mountains are like turbulent waves, joining together to emerge from the sea. Raising the sleeves of the sleeves and waving four seats, Ming Ding An knows.

The sky is full of three rivers, and the round is a thousand miles away. The green osmanthus hides in the distant moon, and the green maple sings the sad ape.

Husha and four blocks, began to dread the sky in Yanqi. The mighty He Liulong moved to Qinxi in the daytime. Nine Saturn points, Aoao Qiqi. The gentleman with the southern crown calls out to the sky and cries. Love the high hall and cover up weeping, tears and blood turn into mud. The prisoner is spring but not grass, lonely and addicted to resentment. Brother Jiujiang Xi brother Three Gorges, mourning the difficulty of eternity. In the north of Mulingguan, I worry about my son, and in the south of Yuzhang, I worry about my old wife. A family of flesh and blood is scattered with hundreds of herbs, and they will no longer accompany each other when they die. The tree hazel pulls out the osmanthus, and the prisoner luan pets the chicken. In the past, Shun granted Yu, and Bo Cheng plowed. Since then, virtue has declined, and I will live in peace. Those who are kind to me will sympathize with me, and those who are not good to me can bear to squeeze each other in danger. Zixu Yiyi, Peng Yueyan.

Touch the top and play with Pangu, push the cart and turn the wheel of the sky. When Yunjian, the sun and the moon were born, he cast fire essence and mercury. Before Yangwu came out of the valley, Gu Tu was half hidden. Nuwa plays with the loess, and the group acts as a fool. Scattered between heaven and earth, like dust. Life and death are endless, who knows that Hu is immortal. The west sea is planted like trees, and the east sea is planted with hibiscus. Don't come for a long time, the branches and leaves are thousands of miles long. There are seven sages in China, halfway to the flood. Your Majesty should be transported, and the dragon flies into Xianyang. The red eyebrows set up the basin, and the white water prospers Hanguang. The world is shaking, and Hong Tao is winnowing. Raise your feet to step on Ziwei, and Tianguan will open itself. Lao Hu felt so virtuous that he came to the east to promote immortality. Master of five colors, emperor of nine buds. It's an old Hu chicken dog, singing and dancing in Feidi Township. Dripping and rustling, advancing and retreating. Can Hu Ge, offer Chinese wine. Kneel on both knees and stand on both elbows. Scattering flowers pointing to the sky, raising plain hands, worshiping Longyan, and offering holy longevity. Beidou ruthless, Nanshan destroyed. The emperor is ninety-nine and eighty-one thousand years old, and he will pour out the long live cup."

Saga triangular bun, the rest of the hair hangs down the waist. Qiu is covered with green wool brocade and dressed in a red frost robe. Carrying a daughter, leisurely playing the flute with the phoenix. The eyebrows were smiling to themselves, and suddenly they were blown by the wind."

If the wind breaks down, it can still shake the dark water. People in the world sneered at me when they saw me, and when they heard Yu's big words. Xuan's father can still be afraid of future generations, and his husband should not be young."

If you search for silk, you will get a double carp, and there is a three-yuan chapter in it. The seal character is like a snake, and its momentum is like flying. Come back and ask the old man, the meaning is immeasurable. The golden knife cuts the green element, and the spiritual writing is brilliant. Swallow the twelve rings and see the immortal room. Go across the purple scales at dusk, the sea air invades the muscles and cools. Long Zi is good at changing and turns into plum blossom makeup. Give me many pearls, the moonlight is extravagant. Advise me to wear crimson thread and tie it as the crotch of the skirt. Take the son with you, talk and laugh and smell the fragrance."
浪漫,李白,上清宝鼎诗二首（附存） 其二,唐,人生烛上花，光灭巧妍尽。春风绕树头，日与化工进。只知雨露贪，不闻零落尽。我昔飞骨时，惨见当涂坟。青松霭朝霞，缥缈山丁村。既死明月魄，无复玻璃魂。念此一脱洒，长啸祭昆崙。醉著鸾皇衣，星斗俯可扪。,Romantic,Li Bai,Two Poems of Baoding in the Shangqing Dynasty (attached) Part 2,"Life is full of candles and flowers, and the light is gone, and the beauty is gone. The spring breeze winds around the tree head, and the sun and the chemical industry advance. I only know that the rain and dew are greedy, but I don't smell it. When I was flying bones in the past, I saw dangtu graves. Green pines and hazy morning glow, misty Shanding village. The soul of the moon is dead, and the soul of glass is gone. Read this free and easy, and make a long cry to sacrifice to Kunlun. Drunk in Luan's emperor's clothes, the stars are palpable."
浪漫,李白,下泾县陵阳溪至涩滩,唐,涩滩鸣嘈嘈，两山足猿猱。白波若卷雪，侧足不容舠。渔子与舟人，撑折万张篙。,Romantic,Li Bai,From Lingyang Creek to Shitan in Xiajing County,"The sound of the beach is noisy, and the two mountains are full of apes.

浪漫,李白,下终南山过斛斯山人宿置酒,唐,暮从碧山下，山月随人归。却顾所来径，苍苍横翠微。相携及田家，童稚开荆扉。绿竹入幽径，青萝拂行衣。欢言得所憩，美酒聊共挥。长歌吟松风，曲尽河星稀。我醉君复乐，陶然共忘机。,Romantic,Li Bai,Descend to Zhongnan Mountain and pass Husi Mountain People's Residence Zhijiu,"In the evening, from the foot of Bishan Mountain, the mountain moon returns with people. But look at the path from where it came, green and green. Hand in hand with Tian's family, childishly opened Jingfei. Green bamboo enters the quiet path, and green radish brushes the clothes. Enjoy the rest of the talk, drink and chat together. The long song sings the pine wind, and the river stars are scarce. I am drunk and happy again, and Tao Ran forgets the opportunity together."
浪漫,李白,下途归石门旧居,唐,吴山高，越水清，握手无言伤别情。将欲辞君挂帆去，离魂不散烟郊树。此心郁怅谁能论，有愧叨承国士恩。云物共倾三月酒，岁时同饯五侯门。羡君素书尝满案，含丹照白霞色烂。余尝学道穷冥筌，梦中往往游仙山。何当脱屣谢时去，壶中别有日月天。俛仰人间易凋朽，钟峰五云在轩牖。惜别愁窥玉女窗，归来笑把洪厓手。隐居寺，隐居山，陶公鍊液栖其间。灵神闭气昔登攀，恬然但觉心绪闲。数人不知几甲子，昨夜犹带冰霜颜。我离虽则岁物改，如今了然失所在。别君莫道不尽欢，悬知乐客遥相待。石门流水遍桃花，我亦曾到秦人家。不知何处得鸡豕，就中仍见繁桑麻。翛然远与世事间，装鸾驾鹤又复远。何必长从七贵游，劳生徒聚万金产。挹君去，长相思，云游雨散从此辞。欲知怅别心易苦，向暮春风杨柳丝。,Romantic,Li Bai,Return to the former residence of Shimen,"Wushan is high, and the water is clear, shaking hands without words hurts love. If you want to say goodbye to the king, hang the sails, and the soul will not be scattered. Who can say that this heart is depressed, and I am ashamed to say that I have inherited the grace of the country. Clouds and things poured wine for three months, and the five princes were preserved together at the age of the year. Xianjun's plain books are full of cases, and the white glow of Handan shines rotten. Yu Chang learned Taoism poorly, and often traveled to fairy mountains in his dreams. Why don't you go when you take off your clothes and thank you, there is no sun, moon and sky in the pot. Looking up at the world is easy to wither and decay, Zhong Feng Wuyun is in Xuanzang. Say goodbye to worry about peeping through the jade girl's window, and laugh at Hong Ya's hand when she returns. She lives in a temple, in a mountain, and Tao Gonglian lives in it. The spirit and spirit held their breath and climbed in the past, calm but feeling idle. I don't know how many people there are, and they still had a frosty face last night. Although I have changed things since the age of the year, now I know where I am missing. Don't be too happy, don't know how to be happy, and stay away from each other. The flowing water in Shimen is full of peach blossoms, and I have also been to the Qin people's house. I don't know where to get chicken pigs, but there are still many mulberry and hemp in it. He is far away from the world, but he is far away again when he pretends to be a luan and rides a crane. Why travel from the seven nobles, and gather thousands of gold products in vain. Yijun to go, longing lovesickness, wandering in the clouds and raining away, and then resigned. If you want to know the melancholy, the heart is easy to suffer, and the spring breeze willow silk in the evening."

浪漫,李白,与从侄杭州刺史良游天竺寺,唐,挂席凌蓬丘，观涛憩樟楼。三山动逸兴，五马同遨游。天竺森在眼，松风飒惊秋。览云测变化，弄水穷清幽。叠嶂隔遥海，当轩写归流。诗成傲云月，佳趣满吴洲。,Romantic,Li Bai,Visiting Tianzhu Temple with his nephew Hangzhou Inspector Liang,"Hang Xiling Pengqiu, watch the waves and rest in the camphor tower. The three mountains are moving and flourishing, and the five horses are traveling together. Tianzhusen is in sight, and the pine wind is frightening autumn. Look at the clouds to measure changes, and make water poor and quiet. The overlapping peaks are separated by the distant sea, and Dangxuan writes back to the flow. Poems become Aoyunyue, and Wuzhou is full of joy."
浪漫,李白,与元丹丘方城寺谈玄作,唐,茫茫大梦中，惟我独先觉。腾转风火来，假合作容貌。灭除昏疑尽，领略入精要。澄虑观此身，因得通寂照。朗悟前后际，始知金仙妙。幸逢禅居人，酌玉坐相召。彼我俱若丧，云山岂殊调。清风生虚空，明月见谈笑。怡然青莲宫，永愿姿游眺。,Romantic,Li Bai,"Discussion on Mysterious Works with Fangcheng Temple in Danqiu, Yuan Dynasty","In the vast dream, I am the only one who realizes first. Turn around and pretend to cooperate. Get rid of confusion and doubts, and appreciate the essence. When you look at this body carefully, you will be able to see through stillness. When you understand the front and back, you begin to know the beauty of the golden fairy. Fortunately, when I met a Zen dweller, I sat down and called for him. He and I are both mourning, how can Yunshan be different? The breeze creates space, and the bright moon talks and laughs. The Qinglian Palace is pleasant, and you will always look forward to it."
浪漫,李白,与周刚清溪玉镜潭宴别,唐,康乐上官去，永嘉游石门。江亭有孤屿，千载迹犹存。我来游秋浦，三入桃陂源。千峰照积雪，万壑尽啼猿。兴与谢公合，文因周子论。扫厓去落叶，席月开清樽。溪当大楼南，溪水正南奔。回作玉镜潭，澄明洗心魂。此中得佳境，可以绝嚣喧。清夜方归来，酣歌出平原。别后经此地，为余谢兰荪。,Romantic,Li Bai,Farewell to Zhou Gang at Qingxi Yujingtan,"Kangle goes to Shangguan, and Yongjia visits Shimen. There is an isolated island in Jiangting, and the traces of thousands of years still exist. I came to visit Qiupu and entered Taopiyuan three times. Thousands of peaks are covered with snow, and thousands of valleys are full of apes. Xing and Xie Gong cooperated, and the text was based on Zhou Zi's theory. Sweeping cliffs to remove fallen leaves, Xi Yue opened clear bottles. The stream is in the south of the building, and the stream is running south. Returning to Yujingtan, clearing the mind and soul. If you get a good place here, you can stop the hustle and bustle. Come back at night, and go out of the plain singing heartily. After leaving this place, it is Yu Xie Lansun."

Yi Yun moves the sea, and the high love goes out of the world. Spirituality can be traced together, and it is indifferent to the world. I come to Wusongxia, and buy wine poorly. It is named Wusong Mountain because of the old people left behind in the ancient times. How quiet the five pines are, the scenic beauty of Wozhou. Xiao Saming caves and ravines, wind and rain all year round. When the sound enters Baiquan, it sounds like the flow of the Three Gorges. Cut bamboo and sweep the ceiling, and travel from proud officials. If the dragon hall can be rested, I want to return to intensive cultivation."
浪漫,李白,与诸公送陈郎将归衡阳,唐,衡山苍苍入紫冥，下看南极老人星。回飙吹散五峰雪，往往飞花落洞庭。气清岳秀有如此，郎将一家拖金紫。门前食客乱浮云，世人皆比孟尝君。江上送行无白璧，临歧惆怅若为分。,Romantic,Li Bai,Sending Chen Lang back to Hengyang with the princes,"Mount Heng is dark and dark, looking down at Canopus in Antarctica. Biao Biao blows away the snow from the five peaks, and often flies down the Dongting. Qi Qingyuexiu is like this, Lang drags his family to gold and purple.

Forget about worry or fake grass, the courtyard is full of Luo Congxuan. The dark lake comes up, and the light rain flies to Nanxuan.

Guangling Road in the Ming Dynasty, I only recall this pouring bottle."
浪漫,李白,于五松山赠南陵常赞府,唐,为草当作兰，为木当作松。兰秋香风远，松寒不改容。松兰相因依，萧艾徒丰茸。鸡与鸡并食，鸾与鸾同枝。拣珠去沙砾，但有珠相随。远客投名贤，真堪写怀抱。若惜方寸心，待谁可倾倒。虞卿弃赵相，便与魏齐行。海上五百人，同日死田横。当时不好贤，岂传千古名。愿君同心人，于我少留情。寂寂还寂寂，出门迷所适。长铗归来乎，秋风思归客。,Romantic,Li Bai,Donated to Nanling Changzan Mansion in Wusong Mountain,"Treat grass as orchid and wood as pine. The fragrance of Lanqiu is far away, and the pine and cold do not change their appearance. Pine orchids depend on each other, and Xiao Ai is full of velvet. Chickens and chickens eat together, Luan and Luan share the same branches. Pick the beads to remove the gravel, but there are still beads. It's really worthy of being embraced by distant guests who vote for famous talents. If you cherish your heart, you will be overwhelmed by whoever you treat. Yu Qing abandoned Zhao Xiang and went with Wei Qi. Five hundred people at sea died on the same day as Tian Heng. It was not good at that time, so how can it be famous through the ages. May you be of the same heart and be merciless to me. Silence is still silence, it's comfortable to go out. The long clip is back, and the autumn wind is thinking about returning to the guest."
浪漫,李白,大庭库,唐,朝登大庭库，云物何苍然。莫辨陈郑火，空霾邹鲁烟。我来寻梓慎，观化入寥天。古木朔气多，松风如五弦。帝图终冥没，叹息满山川。,Romantic,Li Bai,Great court library,"Chaodeng Datingku, the clouds are so blue. Don't distinguish Chen Zhenghuo, Zou Luyan in the air. I came to look for Zishen, and I contemplated it into a few days.

Married to the son-in-law of Hu Yan in Yanshan, I want to bring me back to Yanmen. The pheasant Zhai pheasant came to persuade them, and the southern birds were mostly bullied by the northern birds. Zisai's severe frost is like a sword and halberd, and Cangwu's desire to nest is hard to violate. I swear to the death that I can't go, crying and screaming and tears staining my clothes."
浪漫,李白,书怀赠南陵常赞府,唐,岁星入汉年，方朔见明主。调笑当时人，中天谢云雨。一去麒麟阁，遂将朝市乖。故交不过门，秋草日上阶。当时何特达，独与我心谐。置酒凌歊台，欢娱未曾歇。歌动白纻山，舞回天门月。问我心中事，为君前致辞。君看我才能，何似鲁仲尼。大圣犹不遇，小儒安足悲。云南五月中，频丧渡泸师。毒草杀汉马，张兵夺云旗。至今西二河，流血拥僵尸。将无七擒略，鲁女惜园葵。咸阳天下枢，累岁人不足。虽有数斗玉，不如一盘粟。赖得契宰衡，持钓慰风俗。自顾无所用，辞家方来归。霜惊壮士发，泪满逐臣衣。以此不安席，蹉跎身世违。终当灭卫谤，不受鲁人讥。,Romantic,Li Bai,Shu Huai donated to Nanling Changzan Mansion,"When the year star enters the Han year, Fang Shuo sees the Lord of the Ming Dynasty. Make fun of people at that time, Zhongtian Xie Yunyu. As soon as I went to Qilin Pavilion, I will be good to the market. Therefore, if you can't make friends with each other, the autumn grass will go up every day. At that time, He Teda was in harmony with me alone. Set up wine and stand on the shelf, and the entertainment never stops. Singing to move Baifu Mountain, dancing back to Tianmen Moon. Ask me what's on my mind, and make a speech for you. Look at my talent, how is it like Lu Zhongni. The great sage is still not met, and the little Confucian is sad. In the middle of May in Yunnan, there were frequent mournings for the Lu division. Poisonous weeds killed Han horses, and Zhang Bing captured the cloud flag. So far, Xierhe is bleeding with zombies. There will be no seven captures, Lu Nu cherishes the garden sunflower. Xianyang is the hub of the world, and there are not enough people over the years. Although there are several buckets of jade, it is not as good as a plate of millet. Lai Deqi Prime Minister holds the custom of fishing for comfort. Self-care is useless, leaving home and returning. Frost startled the strong man's hair, tearing up his clothes. In this way, I can't rest easy, and my life experience is wasted. The slander of Wei should be eliminated in the end, and the people of Lu should not be ridiculed."
浪漫,李白,书情寄从弟邠州长史昭,唐,自笑客行久，我行定几时。绿杨已可折，攀取最长枝。翩翩弄春色，延伫寄相思。谁言贵此物，意愿重琼蕤。昨梦见惠连，朝吟谢公诗。东风引碧草，不觉生华池。临玩忽云夕，杜鹃夜鸣悲。怀君芳岁歇，庭树落红滋。,Romantic,Li Bai,"The letter is sent from my younger brother Shi Zhao, Governor of Bing","Since the laughing guest has been traveling for a long time, I will decide when to go. The green poplar can be folded, and the longest branch can be climbed. Playing in the spring scenery gracefully, delaying and sending lovesickness. Whoever says this thing is expensive, wants to value Qiongrui. Yesterday I dreamed of Huilian, singing Xie Gong's poems in the morning. The east wind attracts the green grass, unknowingly giving birth to Huachi. Pro to play suddenly cloud evening, cuckoo cry at night sad. Huai Junfang rests at the age of one year, and the trees in the garden fall red."
浪漫,李白,书情题蔡舍人雄,唐,尝高谢太傅，携妓东山门。楚舞醉碧云，吴歌断清猿。暂因苍生起，谈笑安黎元。余亦爱此人，丹霄冀飞翻。遭逢圣明主，敢进兴亡言。白璧竟何辜，青蝇遂成冤。一朝去京国，十载客梁园。猛犬吠九关，杀人愤精魂。皇穹雪冤枉，白日开氛昏。泰阶得夔龙，桃李满中原。倒海索明月，凌山采芳荪。愧无横草功，虚负雨露恩。迹谢云台阁，心随天马辕。夫子王佐才，而今复谁论。层飙振六翮，不日思腾骞。我纵五湖棹，烟涛恣崩奔。梦钓子陵湍，英风缅犹存。彼希客星隐，弱植不足援。千里一回首，万里一长歌。黄鹤不复来，清风愁奈何。舟浮潇湘月，山倒洞庭波。投汨笑古人，临濠得天和。闲时田亩中，搔背牧鸡鹅。别离解相访，应在武陵多。,Romantic,Li Bai,Cai Sherenxiong,"Taste Gao Xie Taifu, and bring prostitutes to Dongshan Gate. Chu Wu drunk Biyun, Wu Ge broke the ape. Temporarily because of the common people, talk and laugh An Liyuan. Yu also loves this person, and Dan Xiao Ji flies over. When encountering a sage master, dare to speak about prosperity and death. Bai Bi was innocent, and the bluefly became wronged. Once I went to Jingguo, I went to Liangyuan for ten years. The fierce dog barks at Jiuguan, killing the spirit of anger. Huang Qiongxue was wronged, and the atmosphere was dim during the day. The Thai ranks get Kuilong, and peaches and plums fill the Central Plains. Falling over the sea, the moon is bright, and Lingshan picks Fangsun. Ashamed of Hengcao Gong, vain of Yu Luen. Xie Yuntai Pavilion traces, the heart follows the sky. The master Wang Zuocai, who will talk about it now. Layers soared and vibrated Liuhe, thinking about Tengqian soon. I fly across the five lakes, and the waves of smoke collapse and rush. Meng Diaoziling is turbulent, and the British style still exists in Burma. Bi Xike star hidden, weak plant is not enough to help. Looking back for a thousand miles, a long song for a thousand miles. The yellow crane doesn't come back, the breeze is worried. The boat floats on the Xiaoxiang moon, and the mountain falls on the Dongting wave. Throwing into the Mi and laughing at the ancients, Lin Hao obtains harmony in the sky. In the leisure time, in the fields and acres, scratching the back and grazing chickens and geese. There should be more visits in Wuling."

The Lu people re-weaved and made, and the looms and curtains were called. Gu Yu was not as good as an official, so he came to Shandong to learn swordsmanship. Lift the whip to visit the future, and get a laugh at Wenshang Weng. It's not enough to talk about being poor. I can get Liaocheng Gong with one arrow. In the end, he was not rewarded, and he was ashamed to be the same as the people of the time. Go back to the straight road in the west, the setting sun is dark and rainbow. Don't say anything about this, I'm willing to turn Peng."

Zhongwen didn't return it, and raised Qingbo independently. Wusong Mountain with wine, slumped Baiyun song. The moon falls in the middle of the sky, and thousands of miles pass by each other.

With the word Yunjin in his mouth, he flew away with me. The bird goes to Ling Ziyan, and the book stays in front of the window. When you open your mouth and smile, it's a story from an old friend. The old man loves each other deeply, remembering my hard work. I live in Xianyang, and I see Qin Caolu three times.

The waves are overwhelming, Yao consults and sighs, Dayu manages all rivers, and children cry without peeping at home. To kill the turbulent smoke and floods, Kyushu began to silkworms. The harm is to go, bewildered by the wind and sand. The old man who was sent out was crazy and insane, and he wanted to be ridiculed in the early morning. Others don't hesitate to stop their wives, and the public has no way to cross the river. Tigers can be fought, but rivers are hard to rely on. Gong Guo drowns and flows into the sea. There are long whales with white teeth like snow-capped mountains, and the harp hangs in it, but the konghou does not return the sorrow."
浪漫,李白,历阳壮士勤将军名思齐歌,唐,太古历阳郡，化为洪川在。江山犹郁盘，龙虎秘光彩。蓄泄数千载，风云何霮䨴。特生勤将军，神力百夫倍。,Romantic,Li Bai,Liyang strong man Qin general name Si Qi song,"Liyang County in the ancient times turned into Hongchuan. The mountains and rivers are still gloomy, and the dragon and tiger are mysterious. It has been accumulated for thousands of years, what will happen. General Teshengqin, supernatural power."
浪漫,李白,友人会宿,唐,涤荡千古愁，留连百壶饮。良宵宜清谈，皓月未能寝。醉来卧空山，天地即衾枕。,Romantic,Li Bai,friends meeting,"Wash away the sorrows of the ages, and linger on a hundred pots to drink. A good night should be talked about, and Haoyue can't sleep. Drunk to lie on the empty mountain, the world is the quilt pillow."
浪漫,李白,天马歌,唐,天马来出月支窟，背为虎文龙翼骨。嘶青云，振绿发，兰筋权奇走灭没。腾昆崙，历西极，四足无一蹶。鸡鸣刷燕晡秣越，神行电迈蹑慌惚。天马呼，飞龙趋，目明长庚臆双凫。尾如流星首渴乌，口喷红光汗沟朱。曾陪时龙蹑天衢，羁金络月照皇都。逸气棱棱淩九区，白璧如山谁敢沽。回头笑紫燕，但觉尔辈愚。天马奔，恋君轩，駷跃惊矫浮云翻。万里足踯躅，遥瞻阊阖门。不逢寒风子，谁采逸景孙。白云在青天，丘陵远崔嵬。盐车上峻坂，倒行逆施畏日晚。伯乐剪拂中道遗，少尽其力老弃之。愿逢田子方，恻然为我悲。虽有玉山禾，不能疗苦饥。严霜五月凋桂枝，伏枥衔冤摧两眉。请君赎献穆天子，犹堪弄影舞瑶池。,Romantic,Li Bai,pegasus song,"The celestial horse comes out of the Yuezhi Cave, with the back of the tiger wing bone. Hissing Qingyun, revitalizing the green hair, the orchid tendons are gone and gone. Teng Kunlun, Li Xiji, without a setback on all fours. The crowing of the cock brushes the swallows and the moss is more and more, and the gods are moving and the electric steps are in a panic. The heavenly horse shouts, the flying dragon tends, the eyes are bright and the Chang Geng is full of double mallards. The tail is like a shooting star, the head is thirsty, and the mouth is red and sweaty. I used to accompany Shilong on the Tianqu, and the gold and the moon shone on the imperial capital. Ease and edge Lingling nine districts, white as a mountain who would dare to sell. Looking back, I laughed at Ziyan, but felt that I was stupid. Tianma gallops, loves Junxuan, and leaps and frightens the floating clouds. Thousands of miles are enough to wander around, looking at the door from a distance. If you don't meet the cold wind, who will pick the grandson of Yijing. White clouds are in the blue sky, and the hills are far away. The salt cart goes up the steep slope, going backwards and fearing the sun and night. Bole cut and brushed the leftovers of the middle way, and did not do his best to discard them. May every Tian Zifang feel sorry for me. Although there are jade mountains and grasses, they cannot cure the suffering and hunger. Severe frost withered the osmanthus branches in May, and the two eyebrows were destroyed by Fu Ting's injustice. Ask the king to redeem and offer Mu Tianzi, it is still worthy of playing shadow dance in Yaochi."
浪漫,李白,天台晓望,唐,天台邻四明，华顶高百越。门标赤城霞，楼栖沧岛月。凭高登远览，直下见溟渤。云垂大鹏翻，波动巨鳌没。风潮争汹涌，神怪何翕忽。观奇迹无倪，好道心不歇。攀条摘朱实，服药鍊金骨。安得生羽毛，千春卧蓬阙。,Romantic,Li Bai,Tiantai Xiaowang,"The roof is adjacent to the four bright lights, and the Huading is as high as Baiyue. The door marks Chicheng Xia, and the building lives on Cangdao Moon. With Gao Deng's distant view, you can see Ming Bo directly. The cloud hangs down and the big roc turns over, and the undulating giant ao disappears. The tide is raging, and the gods and monsters are here and there. There is no sign of watching miracles, and the heart of good Tao does not rest. Climbing sticks to pick vermilion fruits, taking medicine to chain golden bones. Andre grows feathers, and Qianchun lies in Pengque."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 少年子,唐,青云年少子，挟弹章台左。鞍马四边开，突如流星过。金丸落飞鸟，夜入琼楼卧。夷齐是何人，独守西山饿。,Romantic,Li Bai,miscellaneous song lyrics young son,"The youngest son of Qingyun is on the left side of the platform with a bullet. The pommel horse opened in all directions, suddenly passing by like a shooting star. The golden pill falls into the flying bird, and sleeps in Qionglou at night. Who is Yiqi, who guards the West Mountain alone and is hungry."
浪漫,李白,少年行,唐,君不见淮南少年游侠客，白日毬猎夜拥掷。呼卢百万终不惜，报雠千里如咫尺。少年游侠好经过，浑身装束皆绮罗。蕙兰相随喧妓女，风光去处满笙歌。骄矜自言不可有，侠士堂中养来久。好鞍好马乞与人，十千五千旋沽酒。赤心用尽为知己，黄金不惜栽桃李。桃李栽来几度春，一回花落一回新。府县尽为门下客，王侯皆是平交人。男儿百年且乐命，何须徇书受贫病。男儿百年且荣身，何须徇节甘风尘。衣冠半是征战士，穷儒浪作林泉民。遮莫枝根长百丈，不如当代多还往。遮莫姻亲连帝城，不如当身自簪缨。看取富贵眼前者，何用悠悠身后名。,Romantic,Li Bai,Boys line,"Don't you see the young knight-errants in Huainan, hunting during the day and throwing at night. Hulu million will not hesitate to repay the enemy thousands of miles away. The young ranger is passing by, and he is dressed in all kinds of clothes. Cymbidium accompanies prostitutes, and the scenery is full of singing and dancing. Arrogance is impossible to have, and it has been raised in the chivalrous hall for a long time. A good saddle, a good horse, begs for others, and sells wine for ten thousand five thousand. The heart is exhausted to be a confidant, and the gold is not hesitating to plant peaches and plums. Peaches and plums have been planted several times in spring, and once the flowers fall, they will be renewed. The prefectures and counties are all under the door, and the princes and princes are all from Pingjiao. A man is happy for a hundred years, so why bother to suffer from poverty and disease. A man has been honored for a hundred years, so why bother to be courteous and courteous. Half of the clothes are recruited soldiers, and the poor scholars are Lin Quanmin. The roots of Zhemo's branches are hundreds of feet long, which is not as good as the contemporary ones. It's better to be your own hairpin tassel than to hide your in-laws from even the imperial city. What's the use of the name behind you if you look at the rich and noble in front of you."
浪漫,李白,忆旧游寄谯郡元参军,唐,忆昔洛阳董糟丘，为余天津桥南造酒楼。黄金白璧买歌笑，一醉累月轻王侯。海内贤豪青云客，就中与君心莫逆。迥山转海不作难，倾情倒意无所惜。我向淮南攀桂枝，君留洛北愁梦思。不忍别，还相随，相随迢迢访仙城。三十六曲水回萦，一溪初入千花明。万壑度尽松风声，银鞍金络倒平地，汉东太守来相迎。紫阳之真人，邀我吹玉笙。餐霞楼上动仙乐，嘈然宛似鸾凤鸣。袖长管催欲轻举，汉中太守醉起舞。手持锦袍覆我身，我醉横眠枕其股。当筵意气凌九霄，星离雨散不终朝，分飞楚关山水遥。余既还山寻故巢，君亦归家渡渭桥。君家严君勇貔虎，作尹并州遏戎虏。五月相呼度太行，摧轮不道羊肠苦。行来北凉岁月深，感君贵义轻黄金。琼杯绮食青玉案，使我醉饱无归心。时时出向城西曲，晋祠流水如碧玉。浮舟弄水箫鼓鸣，微波龙鳞莎草绿。兴来携妓恣经过，其若杨花似雪何。红妆欲醉宜斜日，百尺清潭写翠娥。翠娥婵娟初月辉，美人更唱舞罗衣。清风吹歌人空去，歌曲自绕行云飞。此时行乐难再遇，西游因献长杨赋。北阙青云不可期，东山白首还归去。渭桥南头一遇君，酂台之北又离群。问余别恨知多少，落花春暮争纷纷。言亦不可尽，情亦不可极。呼儿长跪缄此辞，寄君千里遥相忆。,Romantic,Li Bai,Reminiscing about old travels and sending Yuan to join the army in Qiaojun,"Recalling Dong Zaoqiu in Luoyang in the past, he built a restaurant for Yu Tianjin Qiaonan. Gold and white biscuits buy songs and laugh, and become princes and princes after getting drunk. The virtuous and powerful Qingyun guest in the world is inseparable from the heart of the king. There is no difficulty in going from mountains to seas, and there is nothing to be ashamed of. I climb osmanthus branches to Huainan, and you stay in Luobei to worry about your dreams. I can't bear to say goodbye, but I still follow each other, and visit the fairy city all the way. Thirty-six curved waters linger, and a stream first enters a thousand flowers. Thousands of valleys are completely loosened by the wind, the silver saddle and gold ties fall to the ground, and the prefect of Handong comes to greet him. The real person of Ziyang invited me to play the jade sheng. Immortal music is playing on the dining xia tower, and the noise is like the singing of luan and phoenix. Sleeve-length pipe reminds people to act lightly, and the prefect of Hanzhong gets drunk and dances. Covering my body with a brocade robe in my hand, I sleep drunk on my buttocks. When the banquet is full of energy, the stars and rain will not end, and the mountains and rivers of Chuguan will fly away. Yu returned to the mountains to find his old nest, and the king also returned home to cross the Wei Bridge. Jun's family, Yan Jun, was brave and brave, and acted as Yin Bingzhou to curb the captives. In May, call Du Taihang, destroying the wheel is not a pain in the gut. It has been a long time since I came to Beiliang, and I feel that you are more precious than gold. The Qiong Cup and the sapphire case made me drunk and full. From time to time, it goes out to the west of the city, and the Jin Temple flows like jasper. Floating boats play water flute and drums, microwave dragon scales and sedge green. Xinglai brings prostitutes to pass by, it is like Yang Hua like snow. If you want to get drunk with red makeup, you should lean towards the sun, and write about Cui'e in a hundred-foot clear pool. Cui'e is beautiful and the moon is shining, and the beauties are singing and dancing Luo Yi. When the breeze blows the song, people go away, and the song flies around the clouds. At this time, carpeace is hard to meet again, and Journey to the West is dedicated to Yang Fu. The Qingyun in Beique is unpredictable, and the white head of Dongshan returns. At the south end of the Wei Bridge, I met you once, and at the north of Fengtai, I was out of the group again. Ask Yu don't hate how much he knows, there are many disputes in the spring and evening of falling flowers. Words can't be exhausted, and feelings can't be extreme. Hu'er knelt down and silenced this speech, sending you thousands of miles away to remember each other."
浪漫,李白,忆秋浦桃花旧游时窜夜郎,唐,桃花春水生，白石今出没。摇荡女萝枝，半摇青天月。不知旧行径，初拳几枝蕨。三载夜郎还，于兹鍊金骨。,Romantic,Li Bai,"Recalling the Peach Blossoms in Qiupu, Changing Yelang in the Old Tour","The peach blossoms are born in spring, and the white stone is now haunted. Shake the girl's dill branch, half shake the blue sky moon. I don't know my old behavior, and I punch a few ferns for the first time. Three years later, Yelang returned, and hereby chained the golden bones."
浪漫,李白,忆崔郎中宗之游南阳遗吾孔子琴抚之潸然感旧,唐,昔在南阳城，唯餐独山蕨。忆与崔宗之，白水弄素月。时过菊潭上，纵酒无休歇。泛此黄金花，颓然清歌发。一朝摧玉树，生死殊飘忽。留我孔子琴，琴存人已殁。谁传广陵散，但哭邙山骨。泉户何时明，长扫狐兔窟。,Romantic,Li Bai,Reminiscing about Cui Lang Zhongzong's trip to Nanyang,"In the past in Nanyang City, we only ate Dushan Fern. Reminiscing with Cui Zongzhi, Baishui makes Suyue. Time passed on Jutan, drinking endlessly. Pan this golden flower, dejected and clear song. Once the jade tree is destroyed, life and death are erratic. Leave me Confucius Qin, the person who kept the piano is dead. Whoever spreads Guangling powder, but cries for the bones of Mangshan Mountain. When will Quando be bright, and sweep the fox and rabbit caves."
浪漫,李白,忆襄阳旧游赠马少府巨,唐,昔为大堤客，曾上山公楼。开窗碧嶂满，拂镜沧江流。高冠佩雄剑，长揖韩荆州。此地别夫子，今来思旧游。朱颜君未老，白发我先秋。壮志恐蹉跎，功名若云浮。归心结远梦，落日悬春愁。空思羊叔子，堕泪岘山头。,Romantic,Li Bai,"Reminiscing about the old trip to Xiangyang, donating a giant to Ma Shaofu","In the past, he was an embankment guest and once went up to the Shangonglou. Open the window and the blue peaks are full, and the Cangjiang River flows in the mirror. With a high crown and a male sword, he bowed to Han Jingzhou. Don't be my master here, I am thinking about the old tour now. Zhu Yanjun is not old, but I have gray hair before autumn. Aspirations may be wasted, and fame is like clouds. Returning to the heart and forming a distant dream, the setting sun hangs the sorrow of spring. Empty thinking of Uncle Yang, shedding tears on the top of the mountain."
浪漫,李白,日夕山中忽然有怀,唐,久卧青山云，遂为青山客。山深云更好，赏弄终日夕。月衔楼间峰，泉漱阶下石。素心自此得，真趣非外惜。鼯啼桂方秋，风灭籁归寂。缅思洪厓术，欲往沧海隔。云车来何迟，抚几空叹息。,Romantic,Li Bai,Suddenly there is a pregnant woman in the mountains,"have been lying on the green mountains and clouds for a long time, so I am a guest of the green mountains. Mountains and deep clouds are better, and you can enjoy them all day and night. The moon holds the peak in the building, and the spring washes up the steps and descends the stone. Suxin has gained from this, the real fun is not a pity. Flying osmanthus crows in autumn, and the wind dies and the music returns to silence. Thinking about the Hongya technique, I want to go across the sea. How late is the cloud car coming? Fu Jikong sighed."
浪漫,李白,日出东南隅行,唐,秦楼出佳丽，正值朝日光。陌头能驻马，花处复添香。,Romantic,Li Bai,southeast corner of sunrise,"Qinlou's beauties are coming out, just in time for the morning sun. Horses can be stationed on the streets, and flowers can add fragrance."
浪漫,李白,月下独酌四首 其一,唐,花间一壶酒，独酌无相亲。举杯邀明月，对影成三人。月既不解饮，影徒随我身。暂伴月将影，行乐须及春。我歌月裴回，我舞影零乱。醒时同交欢，醉后各分散。永结无情游，相期邈云汉。,Romantic,Li Bai,Drink Alone Under the Moon One of Four Songs,"A jug of wine among the flowers, drinking alone without a blind date. Raise your glass to invite the bright moon, and make three people face each other. The moon does not drink, and the shadow follows me.暂伴月将影，But still for a while I want to accompany the moon, 行乐须及春。 I should be to enjoy life in the spring. I sing Yue Peihui, and my dancing shadow is chaotic.醒时同交欢，Pursue pleasure when I am awake, 醉后各分散。 When drunken I reel, our companionship ends. Forever and ruthless travel, we will meet each other for a long time."
浪漫,李白,月下独酌四首 其二,唐,天若不爱酒，酒星不在天。地若不爱酒，地应无酒泉。天地既爱酒，爱酒不愧天。已闻清比圣，复道浊如贤。贤圣既已饮，何必求神仙。三杯通大道，一斗合自然。但得酒中趣，勿为醒者传。,Romantic,Li Bai,Drink Alone Under the Moon,"If the sky does not love wine, the wine star is not in the sky. If the land does not love wine, the land should have no wine springs. Both heaven and earth love wine, and the love of wine is worthy of heaven. It has been heard that the Qing is more holy than the saint, and the Tao is as turbid as a sage. Since the sages have already drunk, why ask the gods. Three cups lead to the road, and one fight is natural. But if you have fun in wine, don't pass it on to the sober."
浪漫,李白,月下独酌四首 其三,唐,三月咸阳城，千花昼如锦。谁能春独愁，对此径须饮。穷通与修短，造化夙所禀。一樽齐死生，万事固难审。醉后失天地，兀然就孤枕。不知有吾身，此乐最为甚。,Romantic,Li Bai,"Drinking alone under the moon, three out of four","In March Xianyang City, thousands of flowers and day like brocade. Who can worry about spring alone, he must drink for this. Poor communication and short-cutting are inherent in good fortune. A bottle of life and death, everything is hard to judge. After getting drunk, I lose the world, and suddenly I am alone. I don't know my body, this is the most joy."
浪漫,李白,月下独酌四首 其四,唐,穷愁千万端，美酒三百杯。愁多酒虽少，酒倾愁不来。所以知酒圣，酒酣心自开。辞粟卧首阳，屡空饥颜回。当代不乐饮，虚名安用哉。蟹螯即金液，糟丘是蓬莱。且须饮美酒，乘月醉高台。,Romantic,Li Bai,Drinking alone under the moon out of four,"There are thousands of poverty and sorrow, and three hundred glasses of fine wine. There is a lot of sorrow, but there is little wine, but the wine does not come to worry. Therefore, the sage of wine knows that wine is heart-warming. Saying goodbye to millet and lying in Shouyang, repeatedly empty and hungry. If you don't enjoy drinking in the contemporary era, the false name is safe and useful. Crab claws are gold liquid, and bad mounds are Penglai. And you must drink fine wine and ride the moon to get drunk on the high platform."
浪漫,李白,月夜江行寄崔员外宗之,唐,飘飘江风起，萧飒海树秋。登舻美清夜，挂席移轻舟。月随碧山转，水合青天流。杳如星河上，但觉云林幽。归路方浩浩，徂川去悠悠。徒悲蕙草歇，复听菱歌愁。岸曲迷后浦，沙明瞰前洲。怀君不可见，望远增离忧。,Romantic,Li Bai,On a moonlit night Jiang Xing sent Cui Yuanwaizongzhi,"The wind is blowing in the river, Xiao Sahai and the trees are autumn. Ascending the beautiful night, hang the mat and move the light boat. The moon turns with the blue mountains, and the water flows with the blue sky. It's as far away as the stars, but I feel the clouds and forests are secluded. Fang Haohao on the way home, go to Youyou in Chuchuan. Painful and sad, the grass rested, and listened to Lingge's song again. The shore song is lost in Houpu, and Shaming overlooks Qianzhou. Huai Jun is invisible, looking far away from worries."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 长干行,唐,妾发初覆额，折花门前剧。郎骑竹马来，绕床弄青梅。同居长干里，两小无嫌猜。十四为君妇，羞颜未尝开。低头向暗壁，千唤不一回。十五始展眉，愿同尘与灰。常存抱柱信，岂上望夫台。十六君远行，瞿塘滟滪堆。五月不可触，猿声天上哀。门前迟行迹，一一生绿苔。苔深不能扫，落叶秋风早。八月胡蝶来，双飞西园草。感此伤妾心，坐愁红颜老。早晚下三巴，预将书报家。相迎不道远，直至长风沙。,Romantic,Li Bai,Miscellaneous Songs Lyrics Changgan Xing,"The concubine's initial payment, the drama in front of the folded flower door. Lang rode a bamboo horse to make green plums around the bed. Living together in Changqian, the two little ones have no suspicions. Fourteen is a gentleman's wife, and she has never been ashamed. Bow your head to the dark wall, and call it once a thousand times. At the fifteenth day, I raised my eyebrows, wishing to share the dust and ashes. How can you go to the husband's platform if you keep the letter of holding the pillar? The sixteen monarchs traveled far, Qutang Yanyudui. May is untouchable, the sound of apes mourns in the sky. Walking late in front of the door, green moss for a lifetime. The moss is too deep to sweep, and the autumn leaves fall early. In August, butterflies come and fly to the grass in the west garden. Feeling this hurts my concubine's heart, sitting and worrying about my beauty. Get off the three buses in the morning and evening, and pre-order the books and newspapers home. It is not far to meet each other until Changfengsha."
浪漫,李白,长歌行,唐,桃李待日开，荣华照当年。东风动百物，草木尽欲言。枯枝无丑叶，涸水吐清泉。大力运天地，羲和无停鞭。功名不早著，竹帛将何宣。桃李务青春，谁能贯白日。富贵与神仙，蹉跎成两失。金石犹销铄，风霜无久质。畏落日月后，强欢歌与酒。秋霜不惜人，倏忽侵蒲柳。,Romantic,Li Bai,long song line,"The peaches and plums will bloom in the sun, and the glory will shine in those days. The east wind moves all kinds of animals, and the vegetation speaks for itself. There are no ugly leaves on dead branches, and clear springs spit out dry water. Vigorously move the world, Xihe never stops. Fame is not early, how will the bamboo and silk be announced. Tao Li Wu youth, who can pass the day. Wealth and immortality are lost in two. Gold and stone are still hard to sell, and wind and frost have no permanent quality. Afraid of the setting sun and the moon, I forcibly sing and drink. Qiushuang did not hesitate to invade Puliu suddenly."
浪漫,李白,东山吟,唐,携妓东土山，怅然悲谢安。我妓今朝如花月，他妓古坟荒草寒。白鸡梦后三百岁，洒酒浇君同所欢。酣来自作青海舞，秋风吹落紫绮冠。彼亦一时，此亦一时，浩浩洪流之咏何必奇。,Romantic,Li Bai,Higashiyama chant,"Bringing prostitutes to Dongtu Mountain, sadly thanking An. My prostitute is like a flower and the moon today, while his prostitute's ancient tomb is cold in the barren grass. The Queen of the White Rooster Dream is three hundred years old, and she sprinkles wine to make everyone happy. Intoxicated from the Qinghai dance, the autumn wind blows down the purple crown. That is also a moment, this is also a moment, why should the chant of the mighty torrent be strange."
浪漫,李白,东武吟,唐,好古笑流俗，素闻贤达风。方希佐明主，长揖辞成功。白日在高天，回光烛微躬。恭承凤凰诏，歘起云萝中。清切紫霄迥，优游丹禁通。君王赐颜色，声价凌烟虹。乘舆拥翠盖，扈从金城东。宝马丽绝景，锦衣入新丰。依岩望松雪，对酒鸣丝桐。因学扬子云，献赋甘泉宫。天书美片善，清芬播无穷。归来入咸阳，谈笑皆王公。一朝去金马，飘落成飞蓬。宾客日疏散，玉樽亦已空。才力犹可倚，不惭世上雄。闲作东武吟，曲尽情未终。书此谢知己，吾寻黄绮翁。,Romantic,Li Bai,Tobu song,"Good ancient jokes and popular customs, I have always heard of virtuous people. Fang Xizuo, the master of the Ming Dynasty, succeeded in making a long bow. The day is high in the sky, and the light candles bow slightly. Respectfully accept the imperial edict of the Phoenix, and rise up in Yunluozhong. Clear and cut Zixiao Jiong, Youyou Dan ban pass. The king bestows color, and the sound price is Ling Yanhong. Chengyu embraces Cuigai and follows Jincheng East. The beautiful scenery of BMW, and the beautiful clothes enter Xinfeng. Looking at the pines and snow by the rocks, and singing silk trees to the wine. Because of learning from the Yang Ziyun, he dedicated a gift to Ganquan Palace. The beautiful films in the book of heaven are good, and the fragrance of Qing is endless. After returning to Xianyang, talking and laughing are all princes. Once I went to the Golden Horse, it fell into a flying canopy. The guests were evacuated on the day, and the jade bottle was empty. You can still rely on your talents, and you are not ashamed of the heroes in the world. I am free to sing Dongwu songs, and the music is not over yet. I thank my confidant for this book, and I am looking for Huang Qiweng."
浪漫,李白,东海有勇妇,唐,梁山感杞妻，恸哭为之倾。金石忽暂开，都由激深情。东海有勇妇，何惭苏子卿。学剑越处子，超然若流星。损躯报夫雠，万死不顾生。白刃耀素雪，苍天感精诚。十步两躩跃，三呼一交兵。斩首掉国门，蹴踏五藏行。豁此伉俪愤，粲然大义明。北海李使君，飞章奏天庭。舍罪警风俗，流芳播沧瀛。名在列女籍，竹帛已光荣。淳于免诏狱，汉主为缇萦。津妾一棹歌，脱父于严刑。十子若不肖，不如一女英。豫让斩空衣，有心竟无成。要离杀庆忌，壮夫所素轻。妻子亦何辜，焚之买虚声。岂如东海妇，事立独扬名。,Romantic,Li Bai,There is a brave woman in the East China Sea,"Liang Shan felt sorry for Qi's wife and wept for her. The gold and stone are suddenly opened temporarily, all of which are deeply affectionate. There is a brave woman in the East China Sea, how can I be ashamed of Su Ziqing. Learn the sword, the more virgin, detached like a shooting star. Hurt your body to repay your husband, and don't care about your life even if you die. The white blade shines on Su Xue, and the sky feels sincere. Ten steps and two jumps, three calls and one engagement. Decapitate and lose the country, and step on the five Zang lines. Excluding the anger of the husband and wife, it is bright and righteous. Li Shijun of Beihai, Fei Zhang played the heavenly court. Give up crimes and police customs, and let the fragrance spread in Cangying. The name is listed as a female, and the bamboo and silk are glorious. Chunyu was exempted from prison, and the Han Lord was Tiying. The concubine sings a song, and she gets rid of her father to be severely punished. If ten sons are unworthy, they are not as good as a female hero. Yu Rang chopped off the empty clothes, but he failed to achieve what he wanted. If you want to avoid killing and celebrate the taboo, what a strong man takes lightly. The wife is also innocent, and she burns her to buy her false voice. How can it be like the woman in the East China Sea, who has become famous independently."
浪漫,李白,代别情人,唐,清水本不动，桃花发岸傍。桃花弄水色，波荡摇春光。我悦子容艳，子倾我文章。风吹绿琴去，曲度紫鸳鸯。昔作一水鱼，今成两枝鸟。哀哀长鸡鸣，夜夜达五晓。起折相思树，归赠知寸心。覆水不可收，行云难重寻。天涯有度鸟，莫绝瑶华音。,Romantic,Li Bai,farewell lover,"The clear water does not move at all, and the peach blossoms bloom on the shore. The peach blossoms make the water color, and the waves shake the spring light. My Yuezi is beautiful, and my son pours out my articles. The wind blows the green qin away, and bends the purple mandarin duck. It used to be a fish in water, but now it has become two birds. Mourning for a long time, the rooster crows, every night reaches five dawns. Fold the acacia tree and give it to Zhicunxin. Covered with water, you can't take it back, and moving clouds are hard to find again. There are birds at the end of the world, Mo Jueyao Huayin."
浪漫,李白,代秋情,唐,几日相别离，门前生稆葵。寒蝉聒梧桐，日夕长鸣悲。白露湿萤火，清霜凌兔丝。空掩紫罗袂，长啼无尽时。,Romantic,Li Bai,Dai Qiuqing,"After a few days of separation, a sunflower was born in front of the door.

Three cups flicking the sword and dancing to the autumn moon, suddenly singing tears and tears. At the beginning of the Phoenix, the Zini Edict was issued, and the emperor called it Shangdeng Yuyan. Brag about the master of the ninefold ten thousand multipliers, and ridicule the waves of Chichi Qing Suoxian. Flying dragons and horses are exchanged for flying dragons and horses, and coral and white jade whips are bestowed. People in the world don't know Dongfang Shuo, and Dayin Jinmen is an exiled immortal. Xi Shi should smile and be happy again, and the ugly woman will be exhausted. Although the king loves eyebrows, he has no choice but to kill people with jealousy in the palace."
浪漫,李白,玉真公主别馆苦雨赠卫尉张卿二首 其一,唐,秋坐金张馆，繁阴昼不开。空烟迷雨色，萧飒望中来。翳翳昏垫苦，沈沈忧恨催。清秋何以慰，白酒盈吾杯。吟咏思管乐，此人已成灰。独酌聊自勉，谁贵经纶才。弹剑谢公子，无鱼良可哀。,Romantic,Li Bai,One of two poems presented to Wei Wei Zhang Qing by bitter rain in Princess Yuzhen's villa,"Sitting in the Jinzhang Pavilion in autumn, it is not open during the cloudy day. The sky was filled with smoke and rain, and Xiao Sa fell in love with it. Yiyi is faint and bitter, and is reminded of deep sorrow and hatred. How comforting is Qingqiu, my cup is full of white wine. Chanting and thinking about wind music, this person has become ashes. Drinking alone and talking about self-encouragement, who is more economical? Master Xie with flicking the sword, there is no fish to be sad."
浪漫,李白,玉真公主别馆苦雨赠卫尉张卿二首 其二,唐,苦雨思白日，浮云何由卷。稷卨和天人，阴阳乃骄蹇。秋霖剧倒井，昏雾横绝巘。欲往咫尺涂，遂成山川限。潨潨奔溜闻，浩浩惊波转。泥沙塞中途，牛马不可辨。饥从漂母食，闲缀羽陵简。园家逢秋蔬，藜藿不满眼。蟏蛸结思幽，蟋蟀伤褊浅。厨灶无青烟，刀机生绿藓。投箸解鹔鹴，换酒醉北堂。丹徒布衣者，慷慨未可量。何时黄金盘，一斛荐槟榔。功成拂衣去，摇曳沧洲傍。,Romantic,Li Bai,Two Poems Presented by Wei Wei and Zhang Qing by Bitter Rain in Princess Yuzhen's Villa,"Bitter rain thinks about the day, why do the clouds roll. Ji Xie and heaven and man, yin and yang are arrogant. Qiulin's drama fell into the well, and the fog and fog swept across. If you want to paint as close as you can, it will become the limit of mountains and rivers. Rushing and rushing to hear the news, Haohao was shocked. In the middle of the mud plug, cattle and horses cannot be distinguished. Hungry from the drifting mother to eat, leisurely adorned with Yuling bamboo slips. When the garden is full of autumn vegetables, the quinoa is full of eyes. Weeds form knots and miss you, and crickets hurt shallow. There is no green smoke from the kitchen stove, and green moss grows on the knife machine. Toss the chopsticks to untie the pheasant, and exchange for the drunk Beitang. The generosity of Dantu civilians is immeasurable. When is the golden plate, a dendrobium recommends betel nuts. After success, he flicked his clothes and swayed beside Cangzhou."
浪漫,李白,玉真仙人词,唐,玉真之仙人，时往太华峰。清晨鸣天鼓，飙歘腾双龙。弄电不辍手，行云本无踪。几时入少室，王母应相逢。,Romantic,Li Bai,Yuzhen Immortal Ci,"The Immortal Yuzhen goes to Taihua Peak.

浪漫,李白,白云歌送刘十六归山,唐,楚山秦山皆白云，白云处处长随君。长随君，君入楚山里，云亦随君渡湘水。湘水上，女萝衣，白云堪卧君早归。,Romantic,Li Bai,Bai Yunge sent Liu Shiliu back to the mountain,"The Chu Mountains and Qin Mountains are all white clouds, and the director of the Baiyun Department follows the king. Long follow the king, the king enters the Chu Mountain, and the cloud also follows the king to cross the Xiangshui River.

浪漫,李白,相和歌辞 白头吟二首 其一,唐,锦水东北流，波荡双鸳鸯。雄巢汉宫树，雌弄秦草芳。宁同万死碎绮翼，不忍云间两分张。此时阿娇正娇妒，独坐长门愁日暮。但愿君恩顾妾深，岂惜黄金买词赋。相如作赋得黄金，丈夫好新多异心。一朝将聘茂陵女，文君因赠白头吟。东流不作西归水，落花辞条归故林。兔丝固无情，随风任颠倒。谁使女萝枝，而来强萦抱。两草犹一心，人心不如草。莫卷龙须席，从他生网丝。且留琥珀枕，或有梦来时。覆水再收岂满杯，弃妾已去难重回。古来得意不相负，祇今惟见青陵台。,Romantic,Li Bai,"Xianghe Geci Baitouyin, one of two poems","Jinshui flows northeast, turbulent with two mandarin ducks. The male nests in the Han palace tree, and the female plays Qin Caofang. Ning Tongwan died to shatter the wings, and couldn't bear to split the clouds. At this time Gillian is jealous, sitting alone on the Nagato, worrying about the sunset. I hope that the king's kindness and concubines are deep, and he would not hesitate to buy poems with gold. Xiangru is gifted with gold, and her husband is so new and different. In one dynasty, a woman from Maoling will be hired, and Wenjun will give her a white-headed chant because of it. The east flow does not make the west return to the water, and the falling flowers and rhetoric return to the old forest. Rabbit silk is ruthless and can be turned upside down with the wind. Who's maid, Luo Zhi, came to hug her. Two grasses are still of one mind, but people's hearts are not as good as grass. Don't roll the dragon's beard mat, and make mesh from him. And leave the amber pillow, or when a dream comes. How can I fill the cup if it is covered with water? The abandoned concubine is gone and it is difficult to return. In ancient times, the pride has not been negative, but now we can only see the Qingling Terrace."
浪漫,李白,白田马上闻莺,唐,黄鹂啄紫椹，五月鸣桑枝。我行不记日，误作阳春时。蚕老客未归，白田已缲丝。驱马又前去，扪心空自悲。,Romantic,Li Bai,Bai Tian immediately heard the warbler,"Orioles peck at purple fruit, and mulberry branches sing in May. I don't keep track of the day when I go, and I mistake it for Yangchun. The old silkworm customers have not returned, but the silk has been reeled in Baitian. Drive the horse and go again, feel empty and feel sad."

And chant the white rice ball to stop the green water, and the long sleeves blow your face to rise up for the king. Cold clouds and frost roll over the sea and sky at night, and Hu Feng blows the sky and floats Saihong. Yuyan is full of joy, and Guanwa sings songs at sunset."
浪漫,李白,白鸠辞,唐,铿鸣钟，考朗鼓。歌白鸠，引拂舞。白鸠之白谁与邻，霜衣雪襟诚可珍。含哺七子能平均，食不噎，性安驯，首农政，鸣阳春。天子刻玉杖，镂形赐耆人。白鹭之白非纯真，外洁其色心匪仁。阙五德，无司晨，胡为啄我葭下之紫鳞。鹰鹯雕鹗，贪而好杀。凤凰虽大圣，不愿以为臣。,Romantic,Li Bai,white dove speech,"Ringing bells, Khao Rang drums. Sing the white dove and lead the dance. Who is the neighbor of the white dove? The frost clothes and snow lapels are sincere and precious. Containing and feeding seven sons can be balanced, food does not choke, sex is peaceful, the first agricultural administration, Ming Yangchun. The emperor engraved a jade stick, and gave it to the elders in a carved shape. The whiteness of egrets is not pure, but the appearance is clean and the heart is benevolent. Que Wude, Wu Sichen, Hu Wei pecked at the purple scales under my reed. Eagles and eagles are greedy and easy to kill. Although Phoenix is a great sage, he doesn't want to be a minister."
浪漫,李白,白毫子歌,唐,淮南小山白毫子，乃在淮南小山里。夜卧松下云，朝餐石中髓。小山连绵向江开，碧峰巉岩绿水回。余配白毫子，独酌流霞杯。拂花弄琴坐青苔，绿萝树下春风来。南窗萧飒松声起，凭崖一听清心耳。可得见，未得亲。八公携手五云去，空馀桂树愁杀人。,Romantic,Li Bai,pekoe song,"Huainan Xiaoshan Baihaozi is in Huainan Xiaoshan. Lying at night under the pine cloud, facing the stone in the meal. The hills open to the river continuously, and the green peaks and rocks return to the green water. The rest is paired with pekoe seeds, and I drink the Liuxia cup alone. Blowing the flowers and playing the piano and sitting on the moss, the spring breeze is coming under the green dill tree. There was a rustling sound at the south window, and Ping Ya could hear it clearly. It can be seen, but not kissed. Bagong went hand in hand with Wuyun, leaving the laurel tree to worry about killing people."
浪漫,李白,示金陵子,唐,金陵城东谁家子，窃听琴声碧窗里。落花一片天上来，随人直渡西江水。楚歌吴语娇不成，似能未能最有情。谢公正要东山妓，携手林泉处处行。,Romantic,Li Bai,Jinlingzi,"In the east of Jinling City, someone's son is eavesdropping on the sound of the piano in the blue window. Falling flowers come up from the sky, and they go straight to the West River with others. Chu Ge and Wu Yujiao are not successful, and it seems that they are not the most affectionate. Xie Gonggong wants Dongshan prostitutes to go everywhere together with Lin Quan."

浪漫,李白,同友人舟行游台越作,唐,楚臣伤江枫，谢客拾海月。怀沙去潇湘，挂席泛溟渤。蹇予访前迹，独往造穷发。古人不可攀，去若浮云没。愿言弄倒景，从此鍊真骨。华顶窥绝溟，蓬壶望超忽。不知青春度，但怪绿芳歇。空持钓鳌心，从此谢魏阙。,Romantic,Li Bai,Boat trip with friends in Taiwan and Yuezuo,"Chu Chen hurt Jiang Feng and thanked the guest for picking up the sea moon. Huaisha went to Xiaoxiang, and hung up the banquet. Jian Yu visited the past, and went alone to make a fortune. The ancients were unattainable, as if the clouds disappeared. If you wish to ruin the scene, you will be true from now on. Huading peeps at the sea, and Penghu looks at Chaohu. I don't know the degree of youth, but I blame Lu Fangxie. Hold the heart of fishing for nothing, and thank Wei Que from now on."
浪漫,李白,同王昌龄送族弟襄归桂阳二首 其一,唐,秦地见碧草，楚谣对清樽。把酒尔何思，鹧鸪啼南园。余欲罗浮隐，犹怀明主恩。踌躇紫宫恋，孤负沧洲言。终然无心云，海上同飞翻。相期乃不浅，幽桂有芳根。,Romantic,Li Bai,One of the two poems with Wang Changling sending his younger brother back to Guiyang,"Qindi sees green grass, and Chu Yao meets Qingzun. How can you think about the wine, and the partridge crows in the South Garden. I want Luo Fuyin, but I still cherish the grace of the Lord Ming.

浪漫,李白,同王昌龄送族弟襄归桂阳二首 其二,唐,尔家何在潇湘川，青莎白石长沙边。昨梦江花照江日，几枝正发东窗前。觉来欲往心悠然，魂随越鸟飞南天。秦云连山海相接，桂水横烟不可涉。送君此去令人愁，风帆茫茫隔河洲。春潭琼草绿可折，西寄长安明月楼。,Romantic,Li Bai,"With Wang Changling sending his family brother back to Guiyang, the second is the second","Where is your family in Xiaoxiangchuan, beside the green sand and white stone Changsha. Yesterday I dreamed that the river flowers were shining on the river day, and a few branches were blooming in front of the east window. Feeling the desire to go, the heart is leisurely, and the soul flies to the south with the bird. Qin Yun is connected with mountains and seas, and the water of Guishui is untouchable. Sending you off here is worrying, and the sails are vast across the river continent. Chuntan Qiongcao green can be folded, and sent west to Chang'an Mingyue Tower."
浪漫,李白,同吴王送杜秀芝赴举入京,唐,秀才何翩翩，王许回也贤。暂别庐江守，将游京兆天。秋山宜落日，秀水出寒烟。欲折一枝桂，还来雁沼前。,Romantic,Li Bai,Send Du Xiuzhi to Beijing with King Wu,"He Pianpian, a scholar, and Xu Hui, the king, are also virtuous.

浪漫,李白,同族弟金城尉叔卿烛照山水壁画歌,唐,高堂粉壁图蓬瀛，烛前一见沧洲清。洪波汹涌山峥嵘，皎若丹丘隔海望赤城。光中乍喜岚气灭，谓逢山阴晴后雪。回溪碧流寂无喧，又如秦人月下窥花源。了然不觉清心魂，祗将叠嶂鸣秋猿。与君对此欢未歇，放歌行吟达明发。却顾海客扬云帆，便欲因之向溟渤。,Romantic,Li Bai,Brother Jincheng Wei Shuqing Candlelight Landscape Mural Song,"The picture of Pengying on the pink wall of the high hall, I saw Cangzhouqing before the candle. The waves are turbulent and the mountains are majestic, and the Jiaoruodan Hill looks at Chicheng across the sea. In the light, the joyous haze suddenly disappears, which means that every mountain is cloudy and sunny and then snows. Huixi Biliu is quiet and quiet, just like Qin people peeking at the flower source under the moon. I don't realize that I don't clear my heart and soul, but only call the autumn apes. The joy with you has not stopped, singing and chanting Da Mingfa. But Gu Haike raised Yunfan, so he wanted to blame Ming Bo for it."

Hu Sha startled Beihai and swept Luoyang River with electricity. The captives rained arrows on the palace, and the emperor's father became disseminated. The king of England accepted the temple plan, and Bing Yue cleared the south. The cloud flag rolls in the sea and snow, and the golden halberd smokes in the river. Gather and disperse millions of people, relax in one sage. The Frost Terrace descends on the crowd, and the Water Kingdom honors Rongzhan. The embroidered clothes open the banquet language, and heaven and man borrow boats from buildings. It's like climbing a golden platform, visiting Zixia fairy from afar. Rolled up and under the braided canopy, I have been in the dark for forty years. Ning Zhicao is a man with a dragon spring under his waist. Floating clouds are making a decision, vowing to be quiet and quiet. I would like to talk quietly about the Golden Chamber with the four princes. Concentric Dai Chaoen, not hesitating to sacrifice a little. Suo Ji's head was destroyed, and he succeeded in chasing Lu Lian."
浪漫,李白,在浔阳非所寄内,唐,闻难知恸哭，行啼入府中。多君同蔡琰，流泪请曹公。知登吴章岭，昔与死无分。崎岖行石道，外折入青云。相见若悲歌，哀声那可闻。,Romantic,Li Bai,In Xunyang Feisuo,"Hearing it is hard to know, weeping, and crying into the mansion. Duojun and Cai Yan, please Cao Gong with tears. Zhideng Wuzhangling, in the past, has nothing to do with death. The rugged stone road turns outside into the blue clouds. Meeting each other is like a sad song, and the mourning can be heard."
浪漫,李白,地藏菩萨赞,唐,本心若虚空，清净无一物。焚荡淫怒痴，圆寂了见佛。五綵图圣像，悟真非妄传。扫雪万病尽，爽然清凉天。赞此功德海，永为旷代宣。,Romantic,Li Bai,Praise of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva,"The original mind is empty, pure and empty. Burning prostitution, anger and ignorance, passed away and saw the Buddha. Five-color pictures and holy images, realizing the truth is not false.

浪漫,李白,安州应城玉女汤作,唐,神女殁幽境，汤池流大川。阴阳结炎炭，造化开灵泉。地底烁朱火，沙傍歊素烟。沸珠跃明月，皎镜函空天。气浮兰芳满，色涨桃花然。精览万殊入，潜行七泽连。愈疾功莫尚，变盈道乃全。濯濯气清泚，晞发弄潺湲。散下楚王国，分浇宋玉田。可以奉巡幸，奈何隔穷偏。独随朝宗水，赴海输微涓。,Romantic,Li Bai,Anzhou Yingcheng jade girl soup,"The Goddess dies in a secluded environment, and the soup pond flows into the great river. Yin and Yang congeal charcoal, and fortune opens Lingquan. There is vermilion fire in the ground, and plain smoke in the sand. The boiling pearl leaps into the bright moon, and the bright mirror covers the sky. The air is full of orchid fragrance, and the color is full of peach blossoms. Browse all kinds of entries, sneak into Qizelian. There is no way to get better when you get sick, but the way to become full is the whole thing. Zhuo Zhuo clears the air, and the Xi hair makes the gurgling. Scatter the Kingdom of Chu and divide it into Song Yutian. You can be lucky, but you can be poor. Alone with the Chaozong water, go to the sea to transport the slight trickle."
浪漫,李白,安州般若水阁纳凉喜遇薛员外乂,唐,翛然金园赏，远近含晴光。楼台成海气，草木皆天香。忽逢青云士，共解丹霞裳。水退池上热，风生松下凉。吞讨破万象，搴窥临众芳。而我遗有漏，与君用无方。心垢都已灭，永言题禅房。,Romantic,Li Bai,Anzhou Prajna Water Pavilion enjoys the cool air and meets Xue Yuanwai,"The golden garden is rewarding, and the distance is full of sunshine. The buildings and terraces are like sea air, and the vegetation is full of heavenly fragrance. Suddenly, I met Qingyun scholars, and they untied Danxia clothes together. When the water recedes, it is hot on the pool, and the wind is blowing to cool the pine. Swallow and destroy all phenomena, and peek at the public. And I left some omissions, and you have no way to use them. All the dirt in the heart is gone, and I will always talk about the meditation room."
浪漫,李白,安陆白兆山桃花岩寄刘侍御绾,唐,云卧三十年，好闲复爱仙。蓬壶虽冥绝，鸾鹤心悠然。归来桃花岩，得憩云窗眠。对岭人共语，饮潭猿相连。时升翠微上，邈若罗浮巅。两岑抱东壑，一嶂横西天。树杂日易隐，崖倾月难圆。芳草换野色，飞萝摇春烟。入远构石室，选幽开上田。独此林下意，杳无区中缘。永辞霜台客，千载方来旋。,Romantic,Li Bai,Anlu Baizhaoshan Peach Blossom Rock Sends Liu Shiyu Wan,"Thirty years in the cloud, I love immortals again after leisure. Although the pot is dark, Luanhe is at ease. When I return to Peach Blossom Rock, I have to sleep in the clouds and windows. People in the mountains talk together, and the apes in the lake are connected. Shisheng Cuiwei goes up, as long as the top of Luofu. Two cens embrace the east valley, and one peak spans the west sky. The sun is easy to hide when the trees are miscellaneous, but the moon is difficult to round when the cliff is tilted. The fragrant grass changes wild colors, and the flying radish shakes the spring smoke. Enter the far-reaching stone chamber and choose Youkai Shangtian. Alone in this forest, there is no middle edge. Yongcishuang Taike, a thousand years to come."
浪漫,李白,寻山僧不遇作,唐,石径入丹壑，松门闭青苔。闲阶有鸟迹，禅室无人开。窥窗见白拂，挂壁生尘埃。使我空叹息，欲去仍裴回。香云遍山起，花雨从天来。已有空乐好，况闻青猿哀。了然绝世事，此地方悠哉。,Romantic,Li Bai,Searching for mountain monks but not encountering works,"The stone path enters Danhe, and the pine gate is closed with moss. There are bird tracks on the idle steps, and no one opens the Zen room. Peeping through the window, you can see the white brush, and there is dust on the wall. Make me sigh in vain, want to go but still come back. Fragrant clouds rise all over the mountains, and flowers rain from the sky. It's already empty and happy, but it's sad to hear that Qingyuan is sad. Knowing the peerless things, this place is leisurely."
浪漫,李白,寻阳送弟昌峒鄱阳司马作,唐,桑落洲渚连，沧江无云烟。浔阳非剡水，忽见子猷船。飘然欲相近，来迟杳若仙。人乘海上月，帆落湖中天。一睹无二诺，朝欢更胜昨。尔则吾惠连，吾非尔康乐。朱绂白银章，上官佐鄱阳。松门拂中道，石镜回清光。摇扇及于越，水亭风气凉。与尔期此亭，期在秋月满。时过或未来，两乡心已断。吴山对楚岸，彭蠡当中州。相思定如此，有穷尽年愁。,Romantic,Li Bai,Seeing Yang to send his younger brother Sima Zuo to Poyang in Changdong,"Sang Luozhou Zhulian, Cangjiang River without clouds and smoke. Xunyang is not on the water, and suddenly I saw Ziyou's boat. Floating to be close, come late like a fairy. People take the moon on the sea, and the sail falls into the sky in the lake. Seeing the same promise, Chaohuan is better than yesterday. Er Ze Wu Hui Lian, Wu Fei Er Kang Le. Zhu Fu Baiyin Zhang, Shangguan Zuo Poyang. The pine door brushes the middle path, and the stone mirror returns to the clear light. Shaking the fan reaches Yuyue, and the water pavilion is cool. This pavilion is in the period of autumn and the moon is full. The past or the future, the hearts of the two towns have been broken. Wushan faces Chu'an, and Pengli Zhongzhou. Lovesickness will be like this, and there will be endless worries."
浪漫,李白,寻阳紫极宫感秋作,唐,何处闻秋声，翛翛北窗竹。回薄万古心，揽之不盈掬。静坐观众妙，浩然媚幽独。白云南山来，就我檐下宿。懒从唐生决，羞访季主卜。四十九年非，一往不可复。野情转萧洒，世道有翻覆。陶令归去来，田家酒应熟。,Romantic,Li Bai,Xunyang Ziji Palace Feels Autumn,"Where can I hear the sound of autumn, and the bamboo in the north window. Returning to the eternal heart, it is not enough to embrace it. The audience is wonderful when sitting quietly, and the awe-inspiring charm is lonely. Bai Yunshan came to live under my eaves. Lazily follow Tang Shengjue, and shamefully visit Jizhu for divination. Forty-nine years have passed, and there is no going back. The wild sentiments have turned chic, and the morals of the world have been turned upside down. When Tao Ling returns home, Tianjia wine should be cooked."
浪漫,李白,寻高凤石门山中元丹丘,唐,寻幽无前期，乘兴不觉远。苍厓渺难涉，白日忽欲晚。未穷三四山，已历千万转。寂寂闻猿愁，行行见云收。高松来好月，空谷宜清秋。溪深古雪在，石断寒泉流。峰峦秀中天，登眺不可尽。丹丘遥相呼，顾我忽而哂。遂造穷谷间，始知静者闲。留欢达永夜，清晓方言还。,Romantic,Li Bai,Xungaofeng Shimen Mountain Zhongyuan Danqiu,"There is no early stage for seeking secluded places, and you will never feel far away when you are happy. Cangya is difficult to walk, and the day is suddenly turning into night. Three or four mountains are not poor, and thousands of turns have been experienced. Silently hear the sorrow of the ape, and see the clouds when you walk. Gao Song comes to a good month, and the empty valley should be clear in autumn. The ancient snow is deep in the stream, and the stone is broken and the cold spring flows. The peaks and ridges are beautiful and the sky is endless. Danqiu called each other from afar, Gu Wo suddenly laughed. So I built a poor valley, and I realized that the quiet ones are idle. Stay happy forever night, Qingxiao dialect also."
浪漫,李白,寻鲁城北范居士失道落苍耳中见范置酒摘苍耳作,唐,雁度秋色远，日静无云时。客心不自得，浩漫将何之。忽忆范野人，闲园养幽姿。茫然起逸兴，但恐行来迟。城壕失往路，马首迷荒陂。不惜翠云裘，遂为苍耳欺。入门且一笑，把臂君为谁。酒客爱秋蔬，山盘荐霜梨。他筵不下箸，此席忘朝饥。酸枣垂北郭，寒瓜蔓东篱。还倾四五酌，自咏猛虎词。近作十日欢，远为千载期。风流自簸荡，谑浪偏相宜。酣来上马去，却笑高阳池。,Romantic,Li Bai,"In the north of Xunlu City, Fan Jushi lost his way and fell into cocklebur. Seeing Fan Zhijiu picking cocklebur","The wild goose is far away in autumn, when the sun is quiet and cloudless. If the guest is not satisfied, what will Haoman do? Suddenly recalling Fan Yeren, raising a quiet posture in a leisurely garden. Dazed to Yixing, but afraid of being late. The city moat loses its way, and the horse head gets lost in the wasteland. He didn't spare Cuiyunqiu, so he was deceived by cocklebur. Get started and smile, who is the king of the arm. Drinkers love autumn vegetables, and Shanpan recommends frost pears. He can't hold chopsticks for a feast, and he forgets his hunger at this feast. The jujube hangs down from the north, and the cold melon grows from the east. He also poured four or five drinks and chanted Tiger Ci. The ten-day joy of recent work is far away from the thousand-year period. Merry from the turbulence, less suitable for the waves. Han Lai got on the horse, but laughed at Gaoyang Chi."
浪漫,李白,当涂赵炎少府粉图山水歌,唐,峨眉高出西极天，罗浮直与南溟连。名公绎思挥彩笔，驱山走海置眼前。满堂空翠如可扫，赤城霞气苍梧烟。洞庭潇湘意渺绵，三江七泽情洄沿。惊涛汹涌向何处，孤舟一去迷归年。征帆不动亦不旋，飘如随风落天边。心摇目断兴难尽，几时可到三山巅。西峰峥嵘喷流泉，横石蹙水波潺湲。东厓合沓蔽轻雾，深林杂树空芊绵。此中冥昧失昼夜，隐几寂听无鸣蝉。长松之下列羽客，对坐不语南昌仙。南昌仙人赵夫子，妙年历落青云士。讼庭无事罗众宾，杳然如在丹青里。五色粉图安足珍，真仙可以全吾身。若待功成拂衣去，武陵桃花笑杀人。,Romantic,Li Bai,Dangtu Zhaoyan Shaofu Fantu Landscape Song,"Emei is higher than the western polar sky, and Luofu is directly connected with Nanming. Minggong Yisi wields a colored pen, drives mountains and seas, and puts it in front of his eyes. The whole hall is full of emerald greens that can be swept away, and Chicheng is full of clouds and smoke. Xiaoxiang in Dongting is full of meaning, and the three rivers and seven lakes are full of love. Where does the turbulent waves go, and the lonely boat goes lost and returns to the year. The sail does not move or spin, it floats like falling into the sky with the wind. The heart shakes and the eyes are broken, and the excitement is endless. When can I reach the top of the three mountains. The west peak is majestic and spouting springs, and the horizontal stones are frowned and the water is gurgling. The east cliffs are covered with light fog, and the deep forest is empty with miscellaneous trees. In it, day and night are lost in ignorance, and there is no silence to hear the cicadas. The feather guests under the long pine sat without saying a word to Nanchang Xian. Mr. Zhao, the immortal of Nanchang, is a scholar who has fallen into the clouds in his wonderful years. There is nothing wrong with Luo Zhongbin in court, as if in Danqing. The five-color pink picture is safe and precious, and the real fairy can be all over my body. If you brush your clothes away after success, Wuling Taohua will kill people with a smile."

The plain piano has no strings, and the wine is made of Gejin. Under the north window of Qingfeng, he calls himself a man of Emperor Xi. When you arrive in Lili, you will see your lifelong relatives."
浪漫,李白,早过漆林渡寄万巨,唐,西经大蓝山，南来漆林渡。水色倒空青，林烟横积素。漏流昔吞翕，沓浪竞奔注。潭落天上星，龙开水中雾。峣岩注公栅，突兀陈焦墓。岭峭纷上干，川明屡回顾。因思万夫子，解渴同琼树。何日睹清光，相欢咏佳句。,Romantic,Li Bai,Longer than Qi Lin Du Ji Wan Ju,"It passes through Dalan Mountain in the west and Qilindu in the south. The color of the water is empty and green, and the forest smoke is horizontally accumulating elements. Leakage, past, swallowing, and waves rushing to pour. The stars fall into the sky in the pool, and the fog in the dragon opens up in the water. Yaoyan is injected into the public gate, and the tomb of Chen Jiao is abrupt. The mountains are steep and dry, and Chuanming looks back repeatedly. Because of thinking about Master Wan, he quenched his thirst with Qiongshu. When will you see the clear light, and sing a good sentence together."
浪漫,李白,早春寄王汉阳,唐,闻道春还未相识，走傍寒梅访消息。昨夜东风入武阳，陌头杨柳黄金色。碧水浩浩云茫茫，美人不来空断肠。预拂青山一片石，与君连日醉壶觞。,Romantic,Li Bai,Send to Wang Hanyang in early spring,"Wen Daochun didn't know each other yet, so he went to visit Hanmei for news. Last night the east wind entered Wuyang, and the willows on the streets were golden. The clear water is vast and the clouds are vast, and the beauty does not come to empty the heart. Brush the green hills and a piece of stone in advance, and drink wine with you for a long time."
浪漫,李白,早秋单父南楼詶窦公衡,唐,白露见日灭，红颜随霜凋。别君若俯仰，春芳辞秋条。泰山嵯峨夏云在，疑是白波涨东海。散为飞雨川上来，遥帷却卷清浮埃。知君独坐青轩下，此时结念同所怀。我闭南楼看道书，幽帘清寂在仙居。曾无好事来相访，赖尔高文一起予。,Romantic,Li Bai,Early Autumn,"The white dew sees the sun disappear, and the beauty withers with the frost. If you don't look up to Jun, Chunfang will say goodbye to Qiutiao. Mount Tai is steep and cloudy in summer, and it is suspected that the white waves rise to the East China Sea. Scattered as Feiyu came up to the river, but the remote curtain was rolled up and cleared. Zhijun sits alone under the Qingxuan, and at this time, he has the same thoughts and feelings. I close the South Tower to read Taoism books, and I live in Xianju with a quiet curtain. There was no good thing to come to visit, so Lyle Gawain gave it together."
浪漫,李白,早秋赠裴十七仲堪,唐,远海动风色，吹愁落天涯。南星变大火，热气馀丹霞。光景不可回，六龙转天车。荆人泣美玉，鲁叟悲匏瓜。功业若梦里，抚琴发长嗟。裴生信英迈，屈起多才华。历抵海岱豪，结交鲁朱家。复携两少女，艳色惊荷葩。双歌入青云，但惜白日斜。穷溟出宝贝，大泽饶龙蛇。明主傥见收，烟霞路非赊。时命若不会，归应鍊丹砂。,Romantic,Li Bai,Presented to Pei Shiqi Zhongkan in early autumn,"The distant sea moves the wind, and the sorrow falls to the end of the world. The southern star becomes a big fire, and the hot air remains Danxia. The scene can't be turned back, the six dragons turn to the sky car. The people of Jing wept for the beautiful jade, and the old man of Lu mourned for the melons. Achievement is like a dream, playing the piano makes a long sigh. Pei Sheng believes in Yingmai, and he has many talents. After arriving in Haidaihao, he made friends with Lu and Zhu's family. Bringing back two young girls, the beauty is amazing. The double song enters the blue sky, but it is a pity that the sun is slanting. Poor Ming produces treasures, and Daze spares dragons and snakes. The Lord of the Ming Dynasty sees the harvest, but the hazy road is not on credit. If the fate of the time is not good, it should be linked to Liandansha."
浪漫,李白,有所思,唐,我思仙人乃在碧海之东隅，海寒多天风，白波连山倒蓬壶。长鲸喷涌不可涉，抚心茫茫泪如珠。西来青鸟东飞去，愿寄一书谢麻姑。,Romantic,Li Bai,Thoughtful,"I think the immortal is in the eastern corner of the blue sea, the sea is cold and windy, and the white waves and mountains are pouring down the pot. The long whale spouts are untouchable, soothing the heart with tears like beads. The blue bird comes from the west and flies to the east. I would like to send a book to thank Magu."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 久别离,唐,别来几春未还家，玉窗五见樱桃花。况有锦字书，开缄使人嗟。至此肠断彼心绝，云鬟绿鬓罢揽结。愁如回飙乱白雪，去年寄书报阳台。今年寄书重相催，胡为东风为我吹行云。使西来，待来竟不来，落花寂寂委青苔。,Romantic,Li Bai,Miscellaneous Songs and Songs,"Don't come home for a few springs, and see cherry blossoms in Yuchuang. In addition, there is a brocade book, and the opening of the seal makes people sigh. At this point, the heart is broken and the heart is broken. Worry is like returning to the white snow, and I sent books and newspapers to the balcony last year. This year, sending books to remind each other again, Hu is the east wind blowing clouds for me. When the west comes, it does not come when it comes, and the fallen flowers are still and moss."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 于阗采花,唐,于阗采花人，自言花相似。明妃一朝西入胡，胡中美女多羞死。乃知汉地多名姝，胡中无花可方比。丹青能令丑者妍，无盐翻在深宫里。自古妒蛾眉，胡沙埋皓齿。,Romantic,Li Bai,Picking Flowers in Khotan,"flower picker in Khotan said that the flowers are similar. Once the concubine Ming entered Hu from the west, the beauties in Hu would die of embarrassment. I know that there are many Shu in Han, but there are no flowers in Hu to compare with. Danqing can make the ugly look good, and they will be in the deep palace without salt. Since ancient times, the eyebrows have been jealous, and Hu Sha has buried his teeth."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 千里思,唐,李陵没胡沙，苏武还汉家。迢迢五原关，朔雪乱边花。一去隔绝域，思归但长嗟。鸿雁向西北，飞书报天涯。,Romantic,Li Bai,Miscellaneous songs and lyrics,"Li Ling did not have Hu Sha, and Su Wu returned to the Han family. All the way to Wuyuan Pass, there are flowers in disorder in the snow. Once I go to the isolated area, I miss returning but sigh for a long time. Swan geese fly to the northwest, flying books to report to the end of the world."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 少年行二首 其一,唐,击筑饮美酒，剑歌易水湄。经过燕太子，结托并州儿。少年负壮气，奋烈自有时。因声鲁句践，争情勿相欺。,Romantic,Li Bai,Miscellaneous Songs and Lyrics Juvenile Walks One of Two,"Fight to build and drink fine wine, swords and songs are easy to drink. After passing through Prince Yan, he was entrusted with Bingzhouer. Young people are full of courage, and sometimes they are fierce. Don't bully each other because of the sound, Lu and sentence practice."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 出自蓟北门行,唐,虏阵横北荒，胡星曜精芒。羽书速惊电，烽火昼连光。虎竹救边急，戎车森已行。明主不安席，按剑心飞扬。推毂出猛将，连旗登战场。兵威冲绝漠，杀气凌穹苍。列卒赤山下，开营紫塞傍。途冬沙风紧，旌旗飒凋伤。画角悲海月，征衣卷天霜。挥刃斩楼兰，弯弓射贤王。单于一平荡，种落自奔亡。收功报天子，行歌归咸阳。,Romantic,Li Bai,Miscellaneous songs and lyrics from Jibeimen Xing,"The barbarian formation traverses the northern wilderness, and Hu Xingyao is brilliant. Yu Shu was shocked by the lightning, and the flames of the beacon continued to shine day and night. Huzhu is in a hurry to save the border, and Rong Chesen has already gone. The Lord of the Ming Dynasty was restless, and flew up according to the heart of the sword. Push the hub out of the fierce general, even the flag on the battlefield. The power of the soldiers rushed to the desert, and the murderous aura soared to the sky. At the foot of Chishan, the soldiers opened camp near Zisai. On the way, the winter sand wind is tight, and the flags are rustling and withered. The corner of the painting is sad and the moon is in the sea, and the clothes are covered with frost. Slash Loulan with a blade, and shoot the virtuous king with a bow. Shan Yuyi is flat, and the seeds fall and die. Repay the emperor with merit, and return to Xianyang with singing."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 北风行,唐,烛龙栖寒门，光曜犹旦开。日月照之何不及此，惟有北风怒号天上来。燕山雪花大如席，片片吹落轩辕台。幽州思妇十二月，停歌罢笑双蛾摧。倚门望行人，念君长城苦寒良可哀。别时提剑救边去，遗此虎文金髀钗。中有一双白羽箭，蜘蛛结网生尘埃。箭空在，人今战死不复回。不忍见此物，焚之已成灰。黄河捧土尚可塞，北风雨雪恨难裁。,Romantic,Li Bai,Miscellaneous Songs and Lyrics in the North,"The candle dragon lives in the cold door, and the light shines brightly. Why can't the sun and the moon shine like this, but the north wind howls up from the sky. The snowflakes in Yanshan Mountain are as big as a mat, blowing down Xuanyuan Terrace in pieces. Youzhou Sifu December, stop singing and laughing double moths. Leaning on the door and looking at pedestrians, thinking about the bitter cold of the Great Wall is sad. Don't take the sword to save the side, leaving behind this golden hairpin with tiger inscriptions. There is a pair of white feather arrows in it, and the spider spins a web to produce dust. The arrow is empty, and people who die in battle today will never return. Can't bear to see this thing, burn it to ashes. The Yellow River can still hold the soil, but the north is hard to deal with the wind and rain."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 发白马,唐,将军发白马，旌节渡黄河。箫鼓聒川岳，沧溟涌洪波。武安有振瓦，易水无寒歌。铁骑若雪山，饮流涸滹沱。扬兵猎月窟，转战略朝那。倚剑登燕然，边峰列嵯峨。萧条万里外，耕作五原多。一扫清大漠，包虎戢金戈。,Romantic,Li Bai,Miscellaneous Songs,"The general sends out a white horse and crosses the Yellow River with Jingjie. The flutes and drums are noisy in Chuanyue, and the Cangming is flooding. There are vibration tiles in Wu'an, but there are no cold songs in Yishui. The iron ride is like a snow mountain, and the drink flows dry Hutuo. Raise your troops to hunt Moon Cave, and turn your strategy towards that. Leaning on the sword to climb Yanran, the peaks are towering. Thousands of miles away in the depression, there are many five plains cultivated. Once the desert is cleared, Bao Hu beats Jin Ge."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 白马篇,唐,龙马花雪毛，金鞍五陵豪。秋霜切玉剑，落日明珠袍。斗鸡事万乘，轩盖一何高。弓摧宜山虎，手接泰山猱。酒后竞风彩，三杯弄宝刀。杀人如剪草，剧孟同游遨。发愤去函谷，从军向临洮。叱咤万战场，匈奴尽波涛。归来使酒气，未肯拜萧曹。羞入原宪室，荒径隐蓬蒿。,Romantic,Li Bai,Miscellaneous Songs and Lyrics White Horse,"Long horse flower snow hair, golden saddle Wuling Hao. The autumn frost cuts the jade sword, and the sunset pearl gown. Cockfighting is a thousand things, how high is the roof. Destroy the Yishan tiger with the bow, and catch the Taishan tiger with the hand. Compete for beauty after drinking, and get a treasured sword with three cups. Killing people is like mowing grass, playing Meng Tongyou. Go to Hangu in anger and join the army to Lintao. Shaking thousands of battlefields, the Xiongnu made waves. When he came back, he was drunk and refused to worship Xiao Cao. Ashamed to enter the original constitutional room, the barren path hides basil."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 行路难三首 其一,唐,金尊清酒斗十千，玉盘珍羞直万钱。停杯投箸不能食，拔剑四顾心茫然。欲渡黄河冰塞川，将登太行雪暗天。闲来垂钓坐溪上，忽复乘舟梦日边。行路难，行路难，多岐路，今安在？长风破浪会有时，直挂云帆济沧海。,Romantic,Li Bai,Miscellaneous Songs and Songs,"Jinzun's wine bucket is worth ten thousand, and the jade plate is ashamed to sell for tens of thousands of dollars. Stopping the cup and throwing the chopsticks, I can't eat, I draw my sword and look around in a daze. If you want to cross the Yellow River, which is blocked by ice, you will climb the snowy sky of Taihang. When I am free to fish and sit on the stream, I suddenly take a boat and dream of the sun. The road is difficult, the road is difficult, there are many roads, where is it now? There will be times when the wind and the waves cleave, hang the clouds and sail straight to the sea."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 行路难三首 其二,唐,大道如青天，我独不得出。羞逐长安社中儿，赤鸡白狗赌梨栗。弹剑作歌奏苦声，曳裾王门不称情。淮阴市井笑韩信，汉朝公卿忌贾生。君不见昔时燕家重郭隗，拥彗折腰无嫌猜。剧辛乐毅感恩分，输肝剖胆效英才。昭王白骨萦蔓草，谁人更扫黄金台。行路难，归去来。,Romantic,Li Bai,Miscellaneous Songs and Songs,"The avenue is like the blue sky, I can't get it alone. Ashamed of chasing children in Chang'an society, red chickens and white dogs bet on pears and chestnuts. Playing swords, singing songs and playing bitter voices, dragging the king's door is not sympathetic. The market in Huaiyin laughed at Han Xin, and the officials of the Han Dynasty hated Jia Sheng. Don't you see that in the past, the Yan family valued Guo Kui, and they had no doubts about Hui Hui. The drama Xin Leyi is grateful, and the infusion of the liver and gallbladder is effective for talents. King Zhao's bones linger in the weeds, who will sweep the golden platform more. Difficult to travel, go back."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 行路难三首 其三,唐,有耳莫洗颍川水，有口莫食首阳蕨。含光混世贵无名，何用孤高比云月。吾观自古贤达人，功成不退皆殒身。子胥既弃吴江上，屈原终投湘水滨。陆机才多岂自保，李斯税驾苦不早。华亭鹤唳讵可闻，上蔡苍鹰何足道？君不见吴中张翰称达士，秋风忽忆江东行。且乐生前一杯酒，何须身后千载名。,Romantic,Li Bai,Miscellaneous Songs and Songs Difficult to Travel,"If you have ears, don't wash Yingchuan water; if you have mouth, don't eat Shouyang fern. Hanguang is expensive and nameless in the world, so what's the use of being lonely and taller than Yunyue. In my view, since ancient times, sages and virtuous people will perish if they do not retreat. Zixu abandoned the Wujiang River, and Qu Yuan finally threw himself into the Xiang River. How can Lu Ji protect himself if he has so many talents? Cranes in Huating can be heard, but what is the goshawk in Shangcai? Don't you see that Zhang Han in Wuzhong is called Dashi, and the autumn wind suddenly recalls Jiangdong. And if you have a glass of wine before your death, why do you need to be famous for thousands of years after you die?"
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 沐浴子,唐,沐芳莫弹冠，浴兰莫振衣。处世忌太洁，志人贵藏辉。沧浪有钓叟，吾与尔同归。,Romantic,Li Bai,Miscellaneous Lyrics Bathing Son,"Don't play the crown in Mufang, and don't shake the clothes in the bath.

浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 侠客行,唐,赵客缦胡缨，吴钩霜雪明。银鞍照白马，飒沓如流星。十步杀一人，千里不留行。事了拂衣去，深藏身与名。闲过信陵饮，脱剑膝前横。将炙啖朱亥，持觞劝侯嬴。三杯吐然诺，五岳倒为轻。眼花耳热后，意气素霓生。救赵挥金槌，邯郸先震惊。千秋二壮士，烜赫大梁城。纵死侠骨香，不惭世上英。谁能书阁下，白首太玄经。,Romantic,Li Bai,Miscellaneous songs and lyrics,"Zhao Keman and Hu Ying, Wu hook is bright with frost and snow. The silver saddle shines on the white horse, rustling like shooting stars. Killing a person in ten steps will never stop a thousand miles away. Hello. After drinking in Xinling, I took off my sword and crossed my knees. Zhu Hai will be roasted, and Hou Ying will be persuaded with a glass of wine. Three cups of turmoil, the five mountains are light. After the eyes are dazzled and the ears are hot, the spirit is born. Rescuing Zhao Huijin gavel, Handan was shocked first. Qianqiu two strong men, Xuan He Daliang City. Even if you die as a hero, you will not be ashamed of being a hero in the world. Who can write your Excellency, the White Head Taixuan Sutra."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 妾薄命,唐,汉帝重阿娇，贮之黄金屋。咳唾落九天，随风生珠玉。宠极爱还歇，妒深情却疏。长门一步地，不肯暂回车。雨落不上天，水覆难再收。君情与妾意，各自东西流。昔日芙蓉花，今成断根草。以色事他人，能得几时好。,Romantic,Li Bai,miscellaneous songs and songs,"The emperor of the Han Dynasty valued Gillian and stored it in a golden house. Cough and saliva fall for nine days, pearls and jade grow with the wind. Love is still resting, jealousy is affectionate but sparse. Nagato took one step at a time, refusing to return to the car temporarily. If the rain does not fall to the sky, it is difficult to collect the water again. Junqing and concubine will flow from east to west. The hibiscus flower in the past is now a rootless grass. How long will it be good for Israel to serve others?"
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 前有一尊酒行二首 其一,唐,春风东来忽相过，金尊绿酒生微波。落花纷纷稍觉多，美人欲醉朱颜酡。青轩桃李能几何？流光欺人忽蹉跎。君起舞，日西夕，当年意气不肯倾，白发如丝叹何益。,Romantic,Li Bai,"There is a wine shop in front of the lyrics of miscellaneous songs, one of two","The spring breeze comes from the east and passes by suddenly, and the golden green wine produces microwaves. The falling flowers feel a little bit more, and the beauties want to get drunk. How many peaches and plums can Qingxuan have? The streamer is deceiving and wasted. You dance, day and night, when the spirit refused to give up, white hair like silk, sighing what benefit."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 前有一尊酒行二首 其二,唐,琴奏龙门之绿桐，玉壶美酒清若空。催弦拂柱与君饮，看朱成碧颜始红。胡姬貌如花，当炉笑春风。笑春风，舞罗衣，君今不醉欲安归。,Romantic,Li Bai,"There is a wine shop in front of the lyrics of miscellaneous songs, two of them","The qin plays the green tung tree of Longmen, and the jade pot of fine wine is as clear as empty.

Laughing at the spring breeze, dancing Luo Yi, you are not drunk now and want to return home in peace."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 春日行,唐,深宫高楼入紫清，金作蛟龙盘绣楹。佳人当窗弄白日，弦将手语弹鸣筝。春风吹落君王耳，此曲乃是升天行。因出天池汎蓬瀛，楼船蹙沓波浪惊。三千双蛾献歌笑，挝钟考鼓宫殿倾。万姓聚舞歌太平，我无为，人自宁。三十六帝欲相迎，仙人飘翩下云軿。帝不去，留镐京。安能为轩辕，独往入窅冥。小臣拜献南山寿，陛下万古垂鸿名。,Romantic,Li Bai,Miscellaneous songs and lyrics Spring Journey,"The deep palace and high-rise buildings enter Ziqing, and the gold is made of dragons and embroidered couplets. The beautiful woman is at the window to brighten the day, and the string will play sign language and play the zither. The spring breeze blows down the king's ears, this song is the journey of ascension to heaven. Because of the pan Pengying out of Tianchi, the buildings and boats frown and the waves startle. Three thousand pairs of moths sang and laughed, and the bells and drums collapsed in the palace. Wan surnames gather to dance and sing in peace, I do nothing, and people are at peace. The thirty-six emperors wanted to greet each other, and the immortals floated down the clouds. If the emperor does not go, stay in Haojing. An Neng is Xuanyuan, and goes to the dark world alone. The minister worships and presents Nanshan's birthday, and His Majesty will be famous forever."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 枯鱼过河泣,唐,白龙改常服，偶被豫且制。谁使尔为鱼，徒劳诉天帝。作书报鲸鲵，勿恃风涛势。涛落归泥沙，翻遭蝼蚁噬。万乘慎出入，柏人以为诫。,Romantic,Li Bai,Miscellaneous Song Lyrics Dry Fish Cross the River Weep,"Bailong changed to regular clothes, but was occasionally restrained by Yuqie. Whoever makes you a fish will sue the Emperor of Heaven in vain. Don't rely on the wind and waves when writing a book to report the whale salamander. The waves fall back to the sand, and they are eaten by ants. Wan Cheng came in and out carefully, and the Bo people thought it admonishment."

Dangerous roots are planted in guest soil, and they will not die in spring. Although grass and trees are ruthless, they can still grow because of their dependence. How to have the same branches and leaves, each has its own withering and prosperous."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 荆州歌,唐,白帝城边足风波，瞿塘五月谁敢过。荆州麦熟茧成蛾，缫丝忆君头绪多，拨谷飞鸣奈妾何。,Romantic,Li Bai,Miscellaneous Songs and Songs of Jingzhou,"There are so many turmoil at the edge of Baidi City, who dares to cross Qutang in May. The wheat in Jingzhou ripens into a cocoon and turns into a moth, reeling the silk and remembering the king's clues, who is the concubine when the valley is flying."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 悲歌行,唐,悲来乎，悲来乎！主人有酒且莫斟，听我一曲悲来吟。悲来不吟还不笑，天下无人知我心。君有数斗酒，我有三尺琴。琴鸣酒乐两相得，一杯不啻千钧金。悲来乎，悲来乎！天虽长，地虽久，金玉满堂应不守。富贵百年能几何？死生一度人皆有。孤猿坐啼坟上月，且须一尽杯中酒。悲来乎，悲来乎！凤鸟不至河无图，微子去之箕子奴。汉帝不忆李将军，楚王放却屈大夫。悲来乎，悲来乎！秦家李斯早追悔，虚名拨向身之外。范子何曾爱五湖，功成名遂身自退。剑是一夫用，书能知姓名。惠施不肯干万乘，卜式未必穷一经。还须黑头取方伯，莫谩白首为儒生。,Romantic,Li Bai,Miscellaneous Songs Lyrics Elegy,"Sadness comes, sorrow comes! If the master has wine, don't pour it out. Listen to me singing a sad song. If I don't sing or laugh when I'm sad, no one in the world knows my heart. You have a few buckets of wine, and I have a three-foot qin. Qinming, wine and music are both in harmony, and a cup is worth a thousand dollars. Sadness comes, sorrow comes! Although the sky is long and the earth is long, a house full of gold and jade should not be guarded. How rich can a hundred years be? Life and death once existed for everyone. The lonely ape sits on the grave and cries for the moon, and must drink all the wine in his glass. Sadness comes, sorrow comes! The phoenix bird does not go to the river without a map, and the weizi goes to the Jizi slave. The Emperor of Han did not remember General Li, and the King of Chu let Dr. Qu go. Sadness comes, sorrow comes! Li Si of the Qin family regretted it early, and turned his false name away from him. Fan Zihe once loved Wuhu, and retired after becoming famous. The sword is for one man, and the book can know the name. Huishi is unwilling to do ten thousand times, so the divination style may not be poor. It is also necessary to take the uncle of the black head, and the head of the white head is a Confucian student."
浪漫,李白,杂言用投丹阳知己兼奉宣慰判官,唐,客从昆崙来，遗我双玉璞。云是古之得道者西王母食之馀，食之可以凌太虚。受之颇谓绝今昔，求识江淮人犹乎比石。如今虽在卞和手，□□正憔悴。了了知之亦何益，恭闻士有调相如。始从镐京还，复欲镐京去。能上秦王殿，何时回光一相眄。欲投君，保君年，幸君持取无弃捐。无弃捐，服之与君俱神仙。,Romantic,Li Bai,Miscellaneous words are used to vote for Danyang confidantes and to comfort judges,"The guest came from Kunlun, leaving me with two jades. It is said that the Queen Mother of the West, who attained the Tao in ancient times, was able to overcome Taixu when she ate her food. It is quite said that the present and the past are absolutely different, and it is better to learn about Jianghuai people than to compare stones. Now in the hands of Bian He, he is haggard. What's the benefit if you know it well? He began to return from Haojing, and wanted to go to Haojing again. If I can go to the Palace of the King of Qin, when will I come back to the light?

Although not as good as Yannianmei, she was also a peerless person at that time. Peaches and plums come out of the deep well, and the flowers are stunning in spring.

I see that the building and the boat have a strong mind, which is quite like a dragon going down to the Three Shu. Raising troops to practice fighting Zhang Huqi, the white waves in the river are like silver houses. Living in a jade tent, Linhe Kui, with a purple beard like a halberd and a crown of Cui Wei. Xiliu opened the camp and bowed to the emperor, only to know that Bashang was a baby. The Qiang flute blows Ah Jinghui horizontally, and blows the plum blossoms in the moon tower.

Stopping and leaning on the forest, startled apes screaming at each other. At night, the Milky Way turns, and it looks dark and wide. The cool wind is rustling, and the flowing water is alive.

In order to marry your husband and son-in-law, you will be free from long-term lovesickness. Unexpectedly, marrying a merchant makes people miserable. Ever since we were husband and wife, why have we ever been in the countryside? Last year, I went to Yangzhou to see off the Yellow Crane Tower. Seeing the sails go far away, my heart follows the river. Just talk about a period of one year, who is called three autumns. Makes the concubine heartbroken and hates the king for a long time. The east house and the west house sent out at the same time, and it took less than a month to go from north to south. I don't know where the luggage is going, and I can cut it off by making a sound book. When traveling to and from Nanpu, I would like to ask the Xijiang boat. Zhengjian was a loaf girl with red makeup for twenty-eight years. One is a wife, how sad alone. Weep when facing the mirror, and just want to cry when meeting people. It's better to be frivolous and follow each other day and night. Regret to be a businessman's wife, parting from youth. Now it happens to be happy together, who will know when you go to Ronghua."

Jiangxia Yellow Crane Tower, Qingshan Hanyang County. Big words can still be heard, but it is difficult for people to see them. Juncao Chen Linxi, I book Lu Lianjian. Serve the country with a strong heart, but Longyan will not return to his family. The Jingwei bird flies west, why is the East China Sea filled. The drums and horns scream in mourning, and the buildings and boats practice fighting. Draw a sword and step on the frosty moon, walk in the empty court at night. Hurting for a long time, forming floating clouds, buried Gu Rong's fan. In the future, he will watch the military appearance and throw a pot to receive a high banquet."

You are near Jiuquan for Zhangye, and I have traveled three miles and nine thousand miles. The heavens and the earth are new and the law is wide, and Yelang's relocation brings frost and cold. Xi Yi's old friend is invisible, Dong Feng blows his dream to Chang'an. Ning Qi met here suddenly, and his surprise was like falling smoke. The jade flute and the golden pipe make a noise at the four feasts, and they are painstaking not to make a long sentence. Yesterday, the embroidered clothes fell to the green statue, and the disease was like peaches and plums. What can I say? In the past, he rode on the Dawan horse of the emperor, but now he rides on the Duan princes' gate. Lai met Nanping, who was open-minded, and his master held a clear theory. There are thousands of miles of clouds like mountains, looking around at the blue sky relieves people's boredom. People are bored and depressed, and it is hard work and hard work. Sorrow comes to drink two thousand stones, and the cold ashes regenerates Yangchun. A monkey can ride a horse when he is drunk, not a romantic master. Toutuo Yunyue is full of monk spirit, and the mountains and rivers have never been satisfactory. Otherwise, Mingjia plays the Cangliu with drums, calling for the daughter of the south of the Yangtze River to sing and sing. I smashed the Yellow Crane Tower for you, and you also smashed Parrot Island for me. Fighting for supremacy in Chibi is like a dream, and you have to sing and dance to be free from worries."
浪漫,李白,纪南陵题五松山,唐,圣达有去就，潜光愚其德。鱼与龙同池，龙去鱼不测。当时版筑辈，岂知傅说情。一朝和殷羹，光气为列星。伊尹生空桑，捐庖佐皇极。桐宫放太甲，摄政无愧色。三年帝道明，委质终辅翼。旷哉至人心，万古可为则。时命或大缪，仲尼将奈何。鸾凤忽覆巢，麒麟不来过。龟山蔽鲁国，有斧且无柯。归来归去来，宵济越洪波。,Romantic,Li Bai,Ji Nanling's inscription on Wusong Mountain,"Shengda has to go and go, hidden light and stupid virtue. The fish and the dragon share the same pool, and when the dragon dies, the fish will never be caught. At that time, I was a generation of builders, but I didn't know that Fu interceded. Once he was with Yin Geng, the phosgene was a star. Yi Yin gave birth to Kongsang and donated it to Pao Zuo Huangji. Tonggong releases Taijia, and the regent is not ashamed. In the third year of Emperor Daoming, he was entrusted with the quality and finally assisted Wing. It is open to the hearts of the people, and it can be done forever. Shi Ming or Da Miao, Zhong Ni will do nothing. The phoenix and the phoenix suddenly overturned the nest, but the unicorn did not come. Guishan hides the country of Lu, with axes but no knives. Come back, come back, the night aid will go beyond the flood."

Raise the whip and move the willow colors, and write about the spring breeze. Enter Guo Deng high-rise, mountains and rivers and clouds.

Carrying Zhonger in Pants, Chujiu and Cheng Ying. Ligu is white-knife, and he must die to show his sincerity. There are three thousand guests in the plain, talking and laughing all the way. Mr. Mao is able to escape, and the two countries are in an alliance. It's all yellow spring soil, which makes me cry. Lei Lei Shi Zigang, Xiao Xiao Bai Yang's voice. The sages are not here, and there are residual inscriptions on the stele. The ancient times share the present, and the origins of mutual mourning and glory. What a shame, thank you Yang Kongming. Zhao Su loves long swords, and scholars are less flattering. Swim leisurely from Boling, and drink the snowy wine. The songs are intoxicating and the water is moving, and the drums shake the Congtai. Return the candle at sunset, and head to Yanjing in the early morning. Fang Chen made five bait strategies, and once made Hu Chen clear."

It first passes through Qutang Gorge, and then walks to the top of Wushan Mountain. Wushan is as high as it is, and Baguo has experienced it all. Climbing dills in the sun, leaning against the Qiongshi outside the clouds. The flying steps are extremely high, and there is no smoke in the extreme eyes. But he missed the boat and the ravine, and looked up at the blue sky. If the blue sky is palpable, the silver man will go and rest there. Looking at the clouds to know Cangwu, remembering the water to distinguish Yinghai. Traveling around the lonely night, the experience is more secluded. The snow is shining on the empty valley, and the sad wind is singing Senke. On the way home, I want to die, but the fun has not yet stopped. Jiang Han sang the ape early, and Song Ming already spit out the moon. The moonlight is so long, the clear ape chirps. Ci Shan couldn't bear to listen to it, so he returned the lonely boat with a wave of his strategy."

The concubine wants to follow the king, and the same is true for lingering. Don't come to the grass in front of the door, the autumn alley turns blue in spring. The chrysanthemum is still alive, full of luxuriant deeds. When the phoenix mingled, the male and the female flew away in shock. Traveling clouds and falling to He Shan, never seeing return. The businessman sent the building, and the acquaintance was in Qiupu. Liang Yuan is empty brocade quilt, and the balcony dreams of rain. The concubine's family became prime ministers three times, and lost power to go to the Western Qin Dynasty. There are still old songs, and the neighbors are sadly heard. The curvature enters the purple cloud, and the cry has no eyes. A concubine is like a peach at the bottom of a well, blooming to whom to smile. The king is like the moon in the sky, and he refuses to take a picture once. The looking glass doesn't recognize yourself, so don't be so haggard. Andy Qin Ji, be kind to humanity."

Wu and Shi are charming and charming, and their clothes shine in Tianjing. Rao Yingqi in the country of water, hidden in the light and lying on the grass. Huigong's real famous monk is a treasure where he is. Open the hall to vibrate the white brush, and talk about the sky. The snow mountain sweeps the powder wall, and there are many new articles by scholars. For the rest of the story, I will talk about the secluded habitat, and describe the beauty of Lingyang.

The jade coffin falls from the sky, and the dragon seal is hidden in the spring. The name flies above the sun and the moon, righteousness and wind and clouds soar.

Hu Maqiu is fat and suitable for white grass, how arrogant is it to ride on the shadows. The golden whip whipped the snow and waved its sheath, half-heartedly calling the eagle out of the outer suburbs.

Cang Cang and distant trees surround Jingmen, sailing boats across Bashui. The water, stones, and ravines are divided into thousands of valleys, and the smoke, light, and grass are full of atmosphere. When did the laughing day of the flowers in the stream come out? How old is Jiang Ke listening to the ape? It makes people feel confused about this, and suspect that it has entered Songqiu's dream cloud."

The dantian is in the jade que, thinking about the sky in the daytime. Grass the real book for me, heaven and man are ashamed of their wonderful work. The Qiyuan Cave is open and falling, and the octagonal star is shining. The three disasters swayed, and the dragon's wings bowed slightly. Raise your hand and thank heaven and earth, nothingness is always there. The hall is full of gold, but the lotus is hard to fill. Laugh at the sergeant in the world, and sink your soul in Bei Luofeng. In the past, Wancheng's tomb has become a Kepeng today. If words of gift are important, they are actually light Huasong."

The ancient love is endless, and the water flows eastward, and the sad wind and poplars here are sad. I take a plain boat to have fun together, and chant Qingchuan Flying Night Shuang. I heard that Niu Zhu chanted five chapters in the past, how can I thank Yuan Jialang now.

The Wei River and the Milky Way are clear, flowing across the sky continuously. The government and the public are full of cultural relics, and the clothes are so beautiful. The stables and horses are scattered in the mountains, and the military appearance is extremely powerful. Yigao Yun Yuanhua, Wei Huo loses muscle strength. The song and the music are not resting, and the glory is old and forced. The circle of light is too full, and the sun moves to the center. Don't disperse the gold in the East China Sea, why fight to fly west and hide. Wuzuo Niushan is sad, full of sorrow and tears."

Lushan shows off the South Douban, the screen is nine folded with clouds and brocades, and the shadow falls on the Minghu Lake with blue and blue light. There are two peaks in front of Jinque, and three stone beams hanging upside down from the Milky Way. The incense burner waterfall faces each other from a distance, and the peaks of the back cliff are Ling Cangcang. The green shadows and red clouds reflect the morning sun, and the birds can't fly to Wu Tianchang. Ascend to the magnificent world, the vast river will not return. Yellow clouds are moving thousands of miles, and white waves are nine flowing snow mountains. It's a Lushan ballad, and it was born because of Lushan. Looking at the stone mirror to clear my heart, the moss is gone at Xie Gongxing's place. Serving early and returning pills has no love for the world, and Qin Xin's three folds are just beginning.

The flowing water in Tianjin is red with blood, and the white bones support each other like a mess. I also ran eastward to the state of Wu, and the road was blocked by floating clouds. The morning crow crows at sunrise in the east, and people at the city gate sweep the falling flowers. Indus and willows blow Jinjing, come to the house of Fufeng Haoshi. Fufeng Haoshi is amazing in the world, and his spirit can be moved. A man does not rely on the power of the general, and he does not care about the period of the book when he drinks alcohol. Carved plates and beautiful food will gather guests, Wu songs and Zhao dances are fragrant and the wind blows. When I first tasted the six kingdoms of Chunling, I was happy to know it. There are three thousand soldiers in each hall, who will be known tomorrow. Stroking the long sword, raising eyebrows, clear water and white stones are separated. Take off my hat, smile at you, drink your wine, and chant for you. Zhang Liang didn't chase the red pine, but the yellow stone beside the bridge knew my heart."
浪漫,李白,把酒问月,唐,青天有月来几时，我今停杯一问之。人攀明月不可得，月行却与人相随。皎如飞镜临丹阙，绿烟灭尽清辉发。但见宵从海上来，宁知晓向云间没。白兔捣药秋复春，嫦娥孤栖与谁邻。今人不见古时月，今月曾经照古人。古人今人若流水，共看明月皆如此。唯愿当歌对酒时，月光长照金樽里。,Romantic,Li Bai,ask the moon,"When will the blue sky and moon come? I will stop drinking today and ask. People can't get the bright moon, but the moon travels with people. It is as bright as a flying mirror facing Danque, and the green smoke is exhausted, and the brilliance is clear. But seeing Xiao coming from the sea, Ning knew that Xiang Yunjian was gone. The white rabbit smashes medicine for autumn and spring, who is Chang'e living alone next to? People today don't see the moon in ancient times, but this month once illuminated the ancients. The ancients and the modern people are like flowing water, and they all look at the bright moon. I only wish that when the song meets the wine, the moonlight will always shine in the golden cup."

Huang Gu and Zhinu are not far apart. There is no magpie bridge in the Milky Way, and there will be peace in time. The boudoir is in charge of money, and the wanderer is in mourning. Ping Bing knows the winter cold, and Frost Dew deceives distant guests. The guests fly like autumn leaves, but they don't say anything about returning. Farewell to the long belt behind the back, worry about the width and go to the time clothes. Take the moon to entrust the night dream, and send the golden emblem because of it."
浪漫,李白,拟古十二首 其二,唐,高楼入青天，下有白玉堂。明月看欲堕，当窗悬清光。遥夜一美人，罗衣沾秋霜。含情弄柔瑟，弹作陌上桑。弦声何激烈，风捲绕飞梁。行人皆踯躅，栖鸟起回翔。但写妾意苦，莫辞此曲伤。愿逢同心者，飞作紫鸳鸯。,Romantic,Li Bai,The second of the twelve ancient poems,"The tall building enters the blue sky, and there is a white jade hall below. The bright moon looks like it wants to fall, when the window hangs clear light. There is a beautiful woman in the remote night, and her clothes are covered with autumn frost. Play softly with affection, play as Moshang Sang. How fierce the sound of the strings is, the wind winds around the flying beams. Pedestrians are walking around, and the perching birds are flying back and forth. But writing a concubine is painful, don't say this song hurts. May those who meet the same heart fly as purple mandarin ducks."
浪漫,李白,拟古十二首 其三,唐,长绳难系日，自古共悲辛。黄金高北斗，不惜买阳春。石火无留光，还如世中人。即事已如梦，后来我谁身。提壶莫辞贫，取酒会四邻。仙人殊恍惚，未若醉中真。,Romantic,Li Bai,The third of the twelve ancient poems,"The long rope is difficult to tie the sun, and since ancient times there have been sorrows and sorrows. Gold high Beidou, do not hesitate to buy Yangchun. There is no light left on the stone and fire, and you are still like a person in the world. That is to say, things are like a dream, and who will I be later. Don't be poor when you carry a pot, and take a wine party with your neighbors. Immortals are in a trance, not as if they are drunk."
浪漫,李白,拟古十二首 其四,唐,清都绿玉树，灼烁瑶台春。攀花弄秀色，远赠天仙人。香风送紫蕊，直到扶桑津。取掇世上艳，所贵心之珍。相思传一笑，聊欲示情亲。,Romantic,Li Bai,Four of the twelve ancient poems,"The green jade trees in Qingdu shine brightly in Yaotai spring.

Lovesickness spreads a smile, and chats to show love."
浪漫,李白,拟古十二首 其五,唐,今日风日好，明日恐不如。春风笑于人，何乃愁自居。吹箫舞彩凤，酌醴鲙神鱼。千金买一醉，取乐不求馀。达士遗天地，东门有二疏。愚夫同瓦石，有才知卷舒。无事坐悲苦，块然涸辙鱼。,Romantic,Li Bai,Five out of the twelve ancient poems,"The weather is fine today, but it might not be as good tomorrow. The spring breeze smiles at others, but He Nai is worried about himself. Playing the flute and dancing the colorful phoenix, drinking sweet carp and god fish. A thousand pieces of gold buys a drunk, and there is nothing left for pleasure. Dashi left the world, and there are two sparse ones at the east gate. Fools are like tiles and stones, but those who are talented know how to roll. Sitting in misery with nothing to do, the block ran dry."
浪漫,李白,拟古十二首 其六,唐,运速天地闭，胡风结飞霜。百草死冬月，六龙颓西荒。太白出东方，彗星扬精光。鸳鸯非越鸟，何为眷南翔。惟昔鹰将犬，今为侯与王。得水成蛟龙，争池夺凤凰。北斗不酌酒，南箕空簸扬。,Romantic,Li Bai,Six of the twelve ancient poems,"The world is closed at a fast speed, and Hu Feng is frosted. Baicao dies in the winter moon, and six dragons decay in the western wilderness. Taibai came out of the east, and the comet shone brightly. Mandarin ducks are not Yue birds, so what is Nanxiang. But the eagles and dogs in the past are now the lords and kings. Get the water to become a dragon, fight for the pond to win the phoenix. The Big Dipper doesn't drink wine, and the Nanji is empty."
浪漫,李白,拟古十二首 其七,唐,世路今太行，回车竟何托。万族皆凋枯，遂无少可乐。旷野多白骨，幽魂共销铄。荣贵当及时，春华宜照灼。人非昆山玉，安得长璀错。身没期不朽，荣名在麟阁。,Romantic,Li Bai,Seven of the twelve ancient poems,"The road of the world is too far away today, so what's the point of entering the car. All races are withered, so there is no less joy. There are many bones in the wilderness, and the ghosts are sold together. The glory should be timely, and the spring flowers should be shining. People are not Kunshan jade, and they are long and bright. The body is immortal, and the honor is in Lin Pavilion."
浪漫,李白,拟古十二首 其八,唐,月色不可扫，客愁不可道。玉露生秋衣，流萤飞百草。日月终销毁，天地同枯槁。蟪蛄啼青松，安见此树老。金丹宁误俗，昧者难精讨。尔非千岁翁，多恨去世早。饮酒入玉壶，藏身以为宝。,Romantic,Li Bai,Eight out of the twelve ancient poems,"The moonlight cannot be swept away, and the guest's worries cannot be explained. Jade dew gives birth to autumn clothes, and fireflies fly to the grass. The sun and the moon will eventually be destroyed, and the heaven and the earth will wither together. The cricket crows at the green pine, and I can see that the tree is old. Gold tannin misleads the vulgar, and it is difficult for those who are ignorant to discuss it carefully. I am not a thousand-year-old man, how I hate to die early. Drink wine into the jade pot, hide yourself as a treasure."
浪漫,李白,拟古十二首 其九,唐,生者为过客，死者为归人。天地一逆旅，同悲万古尘。月兔空捣药，扶桑已成薪。白骨寂无言，青松岂知春。前后更叹息，浮荣安足珍。,Romantic,Li Bai,Nine out of the twelve ancient poems,"The living are passers-by, and the dead are returnees. The heaven and the earth are traveling against each other, and they are in mourning for the eternal dust. The moon rabbit smashes medicine in the air, and Fusang has become a salary.

The sea water is clear and shallow, and Taoyuan can be found at first sight. I left my green jade cup and Ziqiongqin. The cup is used to pour fine wine, and the piano is used to relax the heart. Two things do not exist in the world, how about pearls and gold. Play the qin in the wind in the pine, and the cup persuades the sky to go to the moon. The wind and the moon know each other, so why is the world so sudden."

The Han River flows differently, so does the Chu Mountain. Life is hard to please, how can we grow into a group. Yue Yan likes the sea day, Yan Hong thinks of Shuo Yun. Don't be too late for Ronghua, Langgan can't eat. The sunset knows the sky and the sky is dark, and the dream is long and the road is far away. Wangfu climbed the mountain, but the fossil did not return."

浪漫,李白,求崔山人百丈崖瀑布图,唐,百丈素崖裂，四山丹壁开。龙潭中喷射，昼夜生风雷。但见瀑泉落，如潨云汉来。闻君写真图，岛屿备萦回。石黛刷幽草，曾青泽古苔。幽缄傥相传，何必向天台。,Romantic,Li Bai,Seeking Cui Shanren Baizhangya Waterfall,"The plain cliffs of Baizhang are cracked, and the red walls of the four mountains are opened. Jets are sprayed in the Longtan, and wind and thunder are born day and night. But seeing waterfalls and springs fall, it is like clouds coming from Han Dynasty.

At that time, the autumn moon was good, and Wuchangdu was not reduced. The four seats are drunk and clear, and there is no such thing as joy since ancient times. Langguan loves this water, so it is called Langguan Lake. If the wind is not reduced, the name will be with this mountain."

Bai Yan went to Lin Fei and passed a letter in vain. Shepherding the borderland is bitter, and the setting sun returns to my heart.

Weeping Li Ling's clothes, seeing each other tears turned into blood."

One by one book to report to the deceased, I want to be inspired by it."
浪漫,李白,走笔赠独孤驸马,唐,都尉朝天跃马归，香风吹人花乱飞。银鞍紫鞚照云日，左顾右盼生光辉。是时仆在金门里，待诏公车谒天子。长揖蒙垂国士恩，壮心剖出酬知己。一别蹉跎朝市间，青云之交不可攀。傥其公子重回顾，何必侯嬴长抱关。,Romantic,Li Bai,Give a pen to Dugu Prince Consort,"The captain leaps back towards the sky, and the fragrant wind blows people and flowers flying. The silver saddle and the purple scorpion shine on the clouds and the sun, looking around and looking forward to the brilliance. At that time, the servant was in Jinmen, waiting for the edict bus to pay homage to the emperor. Long bowed to receive the kindness of the country's scholars, with a strong heart to pay confidants.

浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 远别离,唐,远别离，古有皇英之二女，乃在洞庭之南，潇湘之浦。海水直下万里深，谁人不言此离苦。日惨惨兮云冥冥，猩猩啼烟兮鬼啸雨。我纵言之将何补，皇穹窃恐不照余之忠诚。云凭凭兮欲吼怒，尧舜当之亦禅禹。君失臣兮龙为鱼，权归臣兮鼠变虎。或言尧幽囚，舜野死。九疑联绵皆相似，重瞳孤坟竟何是。帝子泣兮绿云间，随风波兮去无还。恸哭兮远望，见苍梧之深山。苍梧山崩湘水绝，竹上之泪乃可灭。,Romantic,Li Bai,farewell,"Far away, in ancient times there was the second daughter of Huangying, who was in the south of Dongting, the Pu of Xiaoxiang. The sea water goes straight down thousands of miles deep, no one can say that this will leave the suffering. The day is miserable, the clouds are dark, and the orangutans are screaming in smoke and ghosts are screaming in the rain. Even if I say what will I do, Huang Qiong is afraid that I will not be loyal to the rest. Yun Ping Xi wants to roar, Yao and Shun should also be Chan Yu. When the king loses his ministers, the dragon becomes a fish, and when the power returns to his ministers, the mouse becomes a tiger. Or say that Yao was imprisoned, and Shun died in the wild. The nine suspicions are all similar, but what is the double-pupil solitary grave? The emperor weeps among the green clouds, and goes with the wind and waves without returning. Weeping and looking far away, I saw the deep mountain of Cangwu. The Cangwu Mountain collapses and the Xiang River dies, and the tears on the bamboo can be extinguished."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 邯郸才人嫁为厮养卒妇,唐,妾本崇台女，扬蛾入丹阙。自倚颜如花，宁知有凋歇。一辞玉阶下，去若朝云没。每忆邯郸城，深宫梦秋月。君王不可见，惆怅至明发。,Romantic,Li Bai,Miscellaneous Songs and Songs,"The concubine worships Taiwanese women, and raises moths into Danque. Since the face is like a flower, I would rather know that there will be a wither. When you go down the jade steps, you will disappear if you go to the cloud.

The pink sun is shining, and the dancing sleeves are blowing the flowers and branches. Take care of the beauties with wine, please sing Handan Ci. How lingering is the Qingzheng, and the green clouds hang down the song. Pingyuanjun is safe, and Kedou grows the ancient pool. There are 3,000 guests, who is known today. I don't have fun in my generation, but I feel sad for future generations."

Thousands of miles away, the fallen leaves will be merged. On the way, I met a good friend and asked me what I was going to do. If you want to offer a timely strategy, whoever sees this heart. The king ruled Liuhe, and Haisai had no fighting. A strong man lies in the grass, worrying and chaotic. Feeling unsatisfied, I sent to Nandu City yesterday. The purple swallows hiss under the tree, and the green pines sing in the box. Throw yourself to the world, and cry out to find heroes. I am ashamed to learn from Langya people, and Long Pan works hard. Wealth and honor I take from myself, meritorious service and spring glory. I am willing to hold your hand, and I will show my affection. Knowing the same person, is it only brother and brother. Baozi makes white clouds, and piano songs make clear sounds. The meaning of parting is hard to say, and each hopes to keep his name."
浪漫,李白,陈情赠友人,唐,延陵有宝剑，价重千黄金。观风历上国，暗许故人深。归来挂坟松，万古知其心。懦夫感达节，壮士激青衿。鲍生荐夷吾，一举置齐相。斯人无良朋，岂有青云望。临财不苟取，推分固词让。后世称其贤，英风邈难尚。论交但若此，友道孰云丧。多君骋逸藻，掩映当时人。舒文振颓波，秉德冠彝伦。卜居乃此地，共井为比邻。清琴弄云月，美酒娱冬春。薄德中见捐，忽之如遗尘。英豪未豹变，自古多艰辛。他人纵以疏，君意宜独亲。奈何成离居，相去复几许。飘风吹云霓，蔽目不得语。投珠冀相报，按剑恐相距。所思采芳兰，欲赠隔荆渚。沈忧心若醉，积恨泪如雨。愿假东壁辉，馀光照贫女。,Romantic,Li Bai,gift to friends,"There is a sword in Yanling, which is worth a thousand gold. Watch the wind and experience the country, and secretly promise the old man deep. When you come back and hang the pine on the grave, you will know your heart forever. The cowards feel the festival, the strong men are excited. Bao Sheng recommended Yiwu, and made him equal in one fell swoop. Sri Lankan people have no good friends, how can they have the hope of Qingyun. Don't hesitate to take the fortune, push the points and give up the words. Later generations called him a sage, but his heroic style is hard to be admired. On friendship, but if this is the case, what is the way of friendship? Many monarchs galloped through Yizao, hiding the people at that time. Shu Wen shakes the waves, and Bingde crowns Yilun. Buju is here, and the common wells are neighbors. Qingqin plays with clouds and moon, fine wine entertains winter and spring. When Bo Dezhong saw the donation, it suddenly seemed like leftover dust. The hero has not changed, and it has been difficult since ancient times. If others are sparse, you should be alone with each other. However, Cheng Li lived away, how many times away from each other. The wind blows the clouds, and the eyes are blinded and speechless. Throw pearls and hope to repay each other, press the sword to fear the distance. I want to pick Fanglan as a gift, and I want to give it to Jingzhu. Shen was worried and drunk, tears of accumulated hatred poured down like rain. May the fake Dongbi shine, and the rest shine on the poor girl."

The lingering smoke curls up in the city, and the carved couplets are hung hundreds of feet down. There are good birds singing in harmony, and the inter-pass is early to get the spring style. The spring breeze swept into the blue clouds, and thousands of households heard the sound of spring. At that time, the king was in Haojing, and the five clouds were hanging down to shine on Ziqing. The battle goes out of the golden palace and turns with the sun, and the jade chariot circles around the flowers when the sky returns. I started to see the dancing cranes in Penglai, and I went to Yishi to listen to the new warblers. The new warbler flies around Shanglinyuan, willing to enter Xiaoshao and mix Fengsheng."
浪漫,李白,单父东楼秋夜送族弟沈之秦,唐,尔从咸阳来，问我何劳苦。沐猴而冠不足言，身骑土牛滞东鲁。沈弟欲行凝弟留，孤飞一雁秦云秋。坐来黄叶落四五，北斗已挂西城楼。丝桐感人弦亦绝，满堂送君皆惜别。卷帘见月清兴来，疑是山阴夜中雪。明日斗酒别，惆怅清路尘。遥望长安日，不见长安人。长安宫阙九天上，此地曾经为近臣。一朝复一朝，发白心不改。屈原憔悴滞江潭，亭伯流离放辽海。折翮翻飞随转蓬，闻弦坠虚下霜空。圣朝久弃青云士，他日谁怜张长公。,Romantic,Li Bai,Single Father East Tower Autumn Night Sends Clan Brother Shen Zhiqin,"You came from Xianyang and asked me why I worked so hard. It's not enough to be crowned with a monkey, but it's not enough to ride a bullock and stagnate in Donglu. Brother Shen wanted to go and stay with his younger brother, but Qin Yunqiu flew alone with a wild goose. The yellow leaves are falling four or five times, and the Big Dipper is hanging on the west tower. The silk tree is so touching, and the whole house will bid farewell to everyone. Rolling up the curtain to see the clear moon coming, it is suspected that it is snowing in the dark night of the mountains. Farewell to the wine fight tomorrow, melancholy clearing the road dust. Looking at the day of Chang'an, I don't see any people from Chang'an. Chang'an palace is on the nine heavens, and this place used to be a close minister. Day after day, my heart never changes. Qu Yuan was haggard and stagnant in the Jiangtan, Tingbo was exiled and sent to Liaohai. Folding the hen and turning the canopy, hearing the strings falling to the sky, the sky is frosty. The pilgrimage has long abandoned Qingyun scholars, who will pity Zhang Changgong in the future."

Where is Tongtang, far away in the west of Xunyang. Green radish hangs on the smoke tree, and white pheasants gather on the sand bank everywhere. Shimen interrupts Pinghu Lake, and Baizhang Jintan shines in the clouds and the sun. Where the Canglang is fishing, the fishing songs with drums and clubs are very interesting. Meet and don't know each other, haunt Tongtang. The clear water on the edge of Pu is clear and plain, and there is no Huansha Wu girl. Walking to the end of the green pond and turning to the secluded, it is suspected that it is Wuling Chunbiliu. In the peach blossoms of chickens and dogs of the Qin people, they will be more ashamed than Tongtangqu. Tongtang couldn't bear to say goodbye, so he returned nine times out of ten. Occasionally, the heart is drunk in a good place, and suddenly a bird comes from the sky. The moon rises from the green hills to see off the son, and the sound of bitter bamboo and autumn sounds all around. Changyin Baixue looks at the galaxy, and Yang Subo hangs down on both feet. Liang Hongde Yao Kuaiji Day, Ning knows that there are many things to do."

Long Jing did not dare to lie down in the water, and when the ape screamed, he heard the sound of the rock. I stayed in Huangshan Bixiyue, but when I listened to it, I stopped playing the qin in the pine. The fruit of the dynasty is Cangzhou Yi, and the wine and rice are frosted and chestnut.

Chaogu Jinling wine, singing Sun Chulou. Suddenly recalled that the embroiderer went to the stone by boat. The grass is wrapped in a black gauze scarf, and it is covered with purple Qi fur. Both sides of the strait clapped their hands and laughed, suspected to be Wang Ziyou. There are dozens of drinkers, and they are drunk and drunk. The waves and the sea guests are shouting at the Marquis of Aoyang. When I meet Wu Ji halfway, the curtain rolls out to ridicule. I recall you here, I don't know madness and shame. As soon as I see you in January, I will return after three cups. Let's go hand in hand and go up the Nandu Bridge. Xingfa sings green water, and Qin Ke shakes it. The cock crows and invites each other again, and the Qing banquet rests in the sky. Give me hundreds of words, every word Ling Fengbiao. On the fur of the clothes, remember every long ballad."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 空城雀,唐,嗷嗷空城雀，身计何戚促。本与鹪鹩群，不随凤凰族。提携四黄口，饮乳未尝足。食君糠秕馀，尝恐乌鸢逐。耻涉太行险，羞营覆车粟。天命有定端，守分绝所欲。,Romantic,Li Bai,Empty City Sparrow,"Alas, the sparrow in the empty city, what's the matter with you. This is with the wren group, not with the Phoenix family. With four yellow mouths, drinking milk is not enough. If you eat the king's chaff and chaff, you may be afraid that the crow and the kite will be chased away. Ashamed of being too dangerous, ashamed of camping. Destiny has a fixed end, keep it and do whatever you want."
浪漫,李白,经下邳圯桥怀张子房,唐,子房未虎啸，破产不为家。沧海得壮士，椎秦博浪沙。报韩虽不成，天地皆振动。潜匿游下邳，岂曰非智勇。我来圯桥上，怀古钦英风。惟见碧流水，曾无黄石公。叹息此人去，萧条徐泗空。,Romantic,Li Bai,Huai Zhang's ovary via Xiapiqiao Bridge,"The ovary is not roaring, and the bankruptcy is not a home. A strong man can be found in the sea, and Qin Bolangsha is the vertebrae. Even if it fails to report to Korea, the heaven and the earth will vibrate. It is not wise and brave to hide and swim in Xiapi. I came to the bridge, nostalgic for ancient Qin Yingfeng. But seeing blue flowing water, there was no Huangshigong. Sigh this person to go, Xu Sikong is depressed."
浪漫,李白,经乱后将避地剡中留赠崔宣城,唐,双鹅飞洛阳，五马渡江徼。何意上东门，胡雏更长啸。中原走豺虎，烈火焚宗庙。太白昼经天，颓阳掩馀照。王城皆荡覆，世路成奔峭。四海望长安，嚬眉寡西笑。苍生疑落叶，白骨空相吊。连兵似雪山，破敌谁能料。我垂北溟翼，且学南山豹。崔子贤主人，欢娱每相召。胡床紫玉笛，却坐青云叫。杨花满州城，置酒同临眺。忽思剡溪去，水石远清妙。雪尽天地明，风开湖山貌。闷为洛生咏，醉发吴越调。赤霞动金光，日足森海峤。独散万古意，闲垂一溪钓。猿近天上啼，人移月边棹。无以墨绶苦，来求丹砂要。华发长折腰，将贻陶公诮。,Romantic,Li Bai,"After the chaos, the place of refuge in Shanzhong was left as a gift to Cui Xuancheng","Two geese fly to Luoyang, and five horses cross the river. When He Yi goes to the east gate, Hu Chu screams even more. Jackals and tigers ran away in the Central Plains, and the ancestral temple was burned. It is too white to pass through the sky, and the decaying sun hides the rest of the sun. The royal city is in turmoil, and the road of the world is steep. Looking at Chang'an from all over the world, smiling with widowed brows. The common people doubt the fallen leaves, and the bones are empty. The company's soldiers are like snow-capped mountains, who can predict the defeat of the enemy. I hang my wings to the north and learn from the Nanshan leopard. Master Cui Zixian, every call for joy. The purple jade flute on the bed of Hu, but sits on the blue cloud and screams. Yanghua Manzhou City, buy wine and look at the same place. Suddenly thinking of the Shanxi River, the water and stones are far away and clear. The snow is all over the sky and the earth is bright, and the wind blows away the lake and mountains. Bored for Luo Shengchan, drunk with Wuyue tune. The red clouds move the golden light, and the sun is full of Senhaiqiao. Dissipate the ancient meaning alone, hang down a stream to fish. Apes cry near the sky, and people move to the side of the moon. There is no bitterness in the ink ribbon, so I come to ask for cinnabar. Huafa grows and bends his waist, which will make Tao Gong scoff at him."

The fairy caresses my top, and the hair is tied for longevity. Mistakenly chasing worldly joy, quite poor reasoning and chaos. Ninety-six holy kings, floating clouds hang empty names. The world gambled and failed to see war. Try the strategy of the overlord, and the future will be crowned. The fate of the time is a big fallacy, abandon it and sail on the sea. Learn swords and turn yourself over, how can you accomplish anything for writing. The sword is not the enemy of ten thousand people, but the text steals the sound of the world. Children's play is not worth mentioning, and Wuxi left Xijing. When I was about to leave, I burst into tears with generosity. Tanjun is suave and talented, and he is the best among all the heroes. Open a feast and invite the ancestral tent to comfort the expedition. The pommel horse is like floating clouds, and I will send Yu Hushi to the pavilion. The song bell is not enough, and the white sunset is in Kunming. When I arrived in Youzhou in October, I was like a star. The king abandoned the North Sea and swept the land to borrow the long whale. Breathing through hundreds of rivers, swallows can be destroyed. I don't know what to say, but I want to live in Pengying. The arc is afraid of Sirius, and dare not open the arrow. Holding tears on the golden platform, crying to the sky and crying to King Zhao. No one valued the bones of the horse, and the ears were empty. Le Yitang was born again, and now he is also on the verge of death. Unsatisfied with wasting time, drive the horse back to your hometown. Feng Jun listens to string songs and sits solemnly in the Huatang. Baili Du Taigu, Tao Ran lying Xihuang. Conquer Lechangle Pavilion, hold a banquet and line up pots and wine cups. Qing'e among the virtuous men is walking towards each other like candles. Drunken dances are in abundance, and clear songs are circling the flying beams. The entertainment is not over, and the rank is full and returns to Xianyang. The ancestors and Taoists have thousands of people, and they look at each other from afar. Thousands of miles apart, prosperity and decline are different. The Yanliang changed several times, and the Nine Earths collapsed. Han Jialian Hu Bing, a sea of sand and dark clouds. The vegetation is murderous, and the stars are dull. The bones of the dead form hills and mountains, what a sin for the common people. Emperor Zhuang lives in Hanguan, and the fate of the country hangs on Geshu. Three hundred thousand long halberds, open the door to accept the evil canal. Public officials are like dogs and sheep, loyal and loyal. The second sage traveled to Henan, and the two capitals were Suiqiu Market. The emperor's son Xu Zhuanzheng, Bingyan controlled and strengthened Chu. Temperance is not Huanwen, and military divisions embrace bears and tigers. When the hearts of the people are lost, the thieves are powerful. But the king's house is solid, and his sincerity and integrity will last forever. The servant lies on the top of the incense burner, and the meal glows in the Yaoquan. The door opens to Jiujiang, and the five lakes are connected under the pillow. In the middle of the night, the navy came, and Xunyang was full of vibes. The empty name is appropriate and wrong, and it threatens to go upstairs to the boat. Just give five hundred gold, but throw it away like floating smoke. Resignation is not rewarded, and Yelangtian is relegated. Yelang Wanli Road, going west makes people old. Sweeping Liuheqing is still negative frost grass. The sun and the moon shine unbiased, so why complain Cang Hao. The good shepherd is called a god, and he is deeply benevolent and compassionate. One visit to Qingyun guest, three visits to the Yellow Crane Tower. Gu Shiyou is a scholar, and you are facing Parrot Island. Fan Shan's domineering spirit is exhausted, and the world is scattered in autumn. The river belts Emei snow, and the river flows across the Three Gorges. Wan Ge came here and sailed across Yangzhou. Sending this Wanlimu to relieve my worries. The screen window is open against the sky, and the water and trees are as green as hair. Peeping at the sun and fearing the mountain, promoting wine and enjoying the moon. Wu Wa and Yue Yan are slim and boast lead red. Hu Lai went up the ladder, and walked out of the curtain with a smile. Hands down to the guest, Luo Yi dances in the spring breeze. The guest kneels down and asks for a rest, the host is not in a good mood. Lanjun Jingshan's work, Jiang Bao can move his face. Hibiscus comes out of clear water, and it is naturally carved. Yixing Hengsu lapel, always looking for. The rich men support the tiger warriors, and the halberds are He Sensen. Cut and chisel bamboo and stone to open, and the lingering flow is clear and deep. Sitting on the stage and sitting in the water pavilion, speaking many English accents. A piece of speech is expensive for white jade, and a promise is light for gold. It is said that I am worthy of the king, and the blue bird is loyal. Magpies among the clouds of five colors come flying up to the sky. It was rumored that the letter of amnesty had arrived, but Yelang was let back. The heating becomes cold, and the smoke is life and death. Jun went to Fengchi, but Jia Shengcai was neglected. The Jie dog still barks at Yao, and the Xiongnu laugh at Qianqiu. Four or five sighs in the middle of the night, often worrying about the big country. There are two mountains between Jing and Ji, and the Yellow River flows in the middle. Even chickens are not allowed to enter, and drinking horses is empty. An Deyi is good at shooting, and one arrow hits his head."
浪漫,李白,茔禅师房观山海图,唐,真僧闭精宇，灭迹含达观。列嶂图云山，攒峰入霄汉。丹崖森在目，清昼疑卷幔。蓬壶来轩窗，瀛海入几案。烟涛争喷薄，岛屿相凌乱。征帆飘空中，瀑水洒天半。峥嵘若可陟，想像徒盈叹。杳与真心冥，遂谐静者玩。如登赤城里，揭步沧洲畔。即事能娱人，从兹得消散。,Romantic,Li Bai,Map of Mountains and Seas Viewed from Zen Master’s Room in the Tomb,"Guan Jingyu, a real monk, has an insight into the disappearance of traces. The peaks of the clouds are listed, and the peaks are gathered into Xiaohan. Dan Yasen is in the eyes, and it is doubtful to roll the curtain in the clear day. Penghu comes to the window, and Yinghai enters a few cases. The waves of smoke are fighting to erupt, and the islands are in chaos. The sail is floating in the air, and the waterfall is sprinkled for half a day. The majesty seems to be achievable, and the imagination is full of sighs. Yao and Zhenxin are in the dark, so those who are harmonious and quiet play. Such as ascending Chicheng, uncovering the banks of Cangzhou. That is to say, things can entertain people, and they will disappear from here."
浪漫,李白,述德兼陈情上哥舒大夫,唐,天为国家孕英才，森森矛戟拥灵台。浩荡深谋喷江海，纵横逸气走风雷。丈夫立身有如此，一呼三军皆披靡。卫青谩作大将军，白起真成一竖子。,Romantic,Li Bai,Dr. Shu,"The heavens conceive talents for the country, and the dense spears and halberds embrace the Lingtai. Mighty and deep plan to spray rivers and seas, vertically and horizontally escape the wind and thunder. The husband stands like this, and he is invincible to the three armies. Wei Qing became a general, and Bai Qi really became a master."

Spring grass is like love, and the mountains are still green. Zhefang is ashamed of distant memories, and Yonglu should be self-satisfied. Seeing the old man's heart from afar is enough for a lifetime. The giant sea accepts all rivers, and Lin Pavilion has many talents. Contribute books to the golden palace, drink wine and serve Qiongyan. I have repeatedly sung by Baiyun and respectfully heard about Huangzhu. Enguang is clumsy and thin, and Yun Han wants to move. The Ming Ding is like a cloud chasing, but the Bian Dan Fang is insignificant. I stay in Jinmen, and you go to Wodanhe. In the three-mountain stage of failure, I am happy and happy in the distance. Xuanzhu sends images, but Chishui is not boundless. I would like to have sex with seagulls in the east and share yams in the west. Lord Qiyan is dead, and there are more dragons in the world. There are different rewards for good days, and you should live idle forever. Birds sing among the trees in the eaves, flowers fall and books are written by the window. You can see the green Xiao in the edge of the river, and see the red stalk in the Xiuxiu. Picking Weixing laughs and sings, what is my love for you. The moon rises between the stone mirrors, and the pine-sounding organ. The mind is self-contained, and the external objects are empty and decadent. Life experience is like forgetting two, from the king's old smoke and water."

Changbo writes about the ages, and his heart and clouds are open. May I ask who came for the Phoenix in the past. I have been gone to Phoenix for a long time, and it is time to return today. Ming Junyue Xixuan, Tianlao sits on three platforms. Haoshi is useless, playing strings and drunken gold. The east wind blows the mountain flowers, and the encore is endless. The six emperors have no secluded grass, and the deep palace is dark with green moss. Don't repeat the way when you buy wine, but urge each other to sing the bell."
浪漫,李白,金陵白下亭留别,唐,驿亭三杨树，正当白下门。吴烟暝长条，汉水齧古根。向来送行处，回首阻笑言。别后若见之，为余一攀翻。,Romantic,Li Bai,Jinling Baixia Pavilion,"The three poplar trees in the post pavilion are just coming down the door.

Luofu Magu Terrace, whether it has gone or not returned. When you meet Jun Pengchiyin, I will eat on the stone. Empty words can't make you happy, but you can't help laughing and cherishing the day and night. The green water faces Yanmen, and the yellow clouds cover Longshan. Sighing the two guest birds, Pei returned to Wu Yuejian. Once the common language is held, it will last for a long time. Get rid of my Ziqi fur, and exchange it for Jinling wine. Come to drink, laugh and sing again, and have a lot of fun. The water shadow plays with the moonlight, and the clear light is nothing to worry about. In the morning, the sails are hung, and the hatred of separation is full of waves."

The white clouds reflect the water and shake the empty city, and the white dew drips down the autumn moon. I meditated under the moon for a long time and did not return. Since ancient times, the eyes of each other have been rare. Jiedao Chengjiang is as pure as practice, which makes people remember Xie Xuanhui forever."

The dragon plate of Zhongshan comes, and the beautiful color divides the Liyang tree. More than forty emperors and three hundred autumns, fame and deeds flowed eastward. Whose family is the son of the white horse child, he will be imprisoned at the age of Taiqing. How strong Jinling was back then, sweeping the world of heroes. The crown and cover are scattered into smoke, and the gold and jade seats are turned into cold ashes. Knocking out the sword and chanting sadly, empty and groaning, Liang Chen's white bones are as messy as a mess. Tianzilong Shenjingjingjing, who sings Yushu backyard flowers. This place is so sad that I can't speak, and I leave the Changchun grass under my eyes. Send Er Changjiang Wanli's heart, he visited Nanshan old man in the past year."

I said to myself who is in charge of Ge, and I have to retreat for a long time. Once the king hangs down and wipes, he cuts his heart and loses Danxue's chest. Suddenly, the daylight returns to the scenery, and it goes straight up to the blue clouds and gives birth to wings. Fortunately, I accompanied Luan chariot out of Hongdu, riding a flying dragon and a heavenly horse. Lords and princes use their colors, and Jin Zhang and purple ribbons come to meet each other. At that time, there were so many friendships, and only the king was the only one who agreed with each other. Wait for me to report to the Lord at the end of the day, and then lie down on the white clouds together."

When I feel that the pillow is not Bishan, I look sideways to the west to block Qinguan. It's still early in the spring of Qilin Pavilion, but I still remember Yiyang when I write a book. The green pine comes to blow the ancient road, and the green radish flies and flowers cover the tobacco. My family's fairy loves halal, the talented grass sage lingers on the ancients, and wants to lie down in Minggao's peerless world. Where is Minggao Weimang? Wuyaxia Water Hengqiao Road. Wearing emerald cloud fur, the sleeves brush away the purple smoke. When you go, you should pass by Song Shaojian, and Acacia is a three-flower tree."
浪漫,李白,鸣皋歌送岑徵君,唐,若有人兮思鸣皋，阻积雪兮心烦劳。洪河凌竞不可以径度，冰龙鳞兮难容舠。邈仙山之峻极兮，闻天籁之嘈嘈。霜厓缟皓以合沓兮，若长风扇海涌沧溟之波涛。玄猿绿罴，舔舕崟岌。危柯振石，骇胆慄魄，群呼而相号。峰峥嵘以路绝，挂星辰于岩㟼。送君之归兮，动鸣皋之新作。交鼓吹兮弹丝，觞清泠之池阁。君不行兮何待，若反顾之黄鹤。扫梁园之群英，振大雅于东洛。巾征轩兮历阻折，寻幽居兮越巘崿。盘白石兮坐素月，琴松风兮寂万壑。望不见兮心氛氲，萝冥冥兮霰纷纷。水横洞以下渌，波小声而上闻。虎啸谷而生风，龙藏溪而吐云。寡鹤清唳，饥鼯嚬呻。魂独处此幽默兮，愀空山而愁人。鸡聚族以争食，凤孤飞而无邻。蝘蜓嘲龙，鱼目混珍。嫫母衣锦，西施负薪。若使巢由桎梏于轩冕兮，亦奚异乎夔龙蹩躠于风尘。哭何苦而救楚，笑何誇而却秦。吾诚不能学二子沽名矫节以耀世兮，固将弃天地而遗身。白鸥兮飞来，长与君兮相亲。,Romantic,Li Bai,Song Minggao sends Cen Zhengjun,"If someone is thinking about Minggao, he will be troubled by the accumulation of snow. The Lingjing of the Honghe River cannot be passed through, and the scales of the ice dragon cannot be tolerated. Miaoxian Mountain is extremely steep, and the sounds of nature are heard. Frost cliffs are bright and bright, like long fans and seas surging waves of the dark sea. The black ape is green, licking the legs and groaning. Dangerous Ke Zhenshi, terrified and trembling, the crowd shouted and greeted each other. The peak is towering and the road is dead, and the stars are hung on the rocks. Sending you back to Xi, moving Minggao's new work. Playing drums and playing silk, drinking in the clear and cool pool pavilion. If you can't do it, how can you treat it, if you look back at the yellow crane. The group of heroes in Sweeping Liang Garden is as elegant as Dongluo. Towel Zhengxuan, experience obstacles and folds, and find a secluded residence, more and more. Sitting on the white stone in the plain moon, the zither and the pine wind are silent in the vast valley. I can't see, my heart is full of atmosphere, and there are many scorpions. Below the horizontal hole of the water is Lu, and the waves are heard in a low voice. The tiger roars in the valley to generate wind, and the dragon hides the stream to spit out clouds. The widowed cranes are silent, and the hungry glider groans. The soul is alone here, humorous, empty and sad. Chickens gather together to compete for food, and phoenixes fly alone without neighbors. Chaflies mock dragons, and fish eyes are mixed with treasures. Xi Shi pays the salary for the brocade clothes worn by the mother. If the nest is shackled in Xuanmianxi, it is also different from Kuilong's lameness in the wind and dust. Why cry and save Chu, laugh and boast but turn away Qin. I sincerely can't imitate the second son's fame and falsehood to glorify the world, and I will abandon the world and die. The white gulls fly here, long to have a blind date with Jun Xi."

Holding the reed branches one by one, they flew south and scattered between the sky and the earth. Back and forth back and forth, living in Yanbo and sending to Hunan and Wu.

Ning Qi did not Kuang Qi, Chen Ping ended up in Zuo Han. Sweeping Heluo by hand, cutting the gap in half. After several years, the party has not moved, and Yunlei has repeatedly encountered difficulties. The heaven and the man hold the battleaxe, and the tiger and bamboo light the Han. Serve the pen on the golden platform, pass on the sapphire case. Don't sigh because of the autumn wind. The master will be slandered, and the king's master will suddenly rebel. From the white sands, there is a lot of noise on the Danyang shore. Bin Yu is like floating clouds, dissipating from the wind. The fingers in the middle of the boat are charming, and the remains of the city are fighting for the fire. Hastily leave the near pass, and do not calculate beforehand. The sparks of the Nanbun drama, and the northern bandits have no boundaries. I don't care about the seven treasure whips, so I linger around the road to play. Taibai eats Pleiades at night, and Changhong goes through in the middle of the day. Qin Zhao Xing Tianbing, the vast Kyushu is in chaos. I am grateful for the kindness of the Lord Ming, and I am quite proud of the words of my ancestors. Crossing the river and swearing to flow, aiming at the Central Plains of the Qing Dynasty. Draw the sword and hit the front pillar, the sad song is hard to say."

The real residence of Baishui, the Luochang shopping mall of Wanshang. Tall buildings face Zimo, and the first one connects to the green hills. There are so many heroes here, so unattainable. Tao Zhu and Wu Yan are famous all over the world. Lihua is beautiful and beautiful, and Han women are charming and beautiful.

Call children to cook chicken and drink white wine, children laugh and hold clothes. Singing high to get drunk and masturbating, dancing and setting the sun to fight for glory. It's not too early to lobby for Wan Cheng's suffering, and to travel long distances with a whip. The foolish women in Kuaiji bought ministers lightly, and Yu Yi resigned from his family and went west to Qin. Looking up to the sky and laughing, I went out, how can I be from Penghao?"

Many monarchs adhere to the ancient festival, and Yue Li crowns Cao. When I was a romantic teenager, I traveled around Jingluo. The Yanling sword at the waist, and the pearl robe with the jade belt. I used to be a cockfighter, Lianyan Wulinghao. Invite the cover-up organization, scare and suffer. The king opens thousands of people, and the pommel horses are all changed. Urgent Qing Xiantai, get rid of Yubeimene. Jianzai Jiangyangyi, cut the thorn tree Lanfang. The gate of the city is so solemn, May flies to autumn frost. Good birds gather precious trees, and high talents lie in Huatang. When I returned from the mansion, the silk pipes seemed to be in a row. But suffering is far away, there is no reason to share the wine. The lotus blossoms in the north of the Yangtze River, and the red bayberry in the south of the Yangtze River is ripe. When drinking, Huaixian is in his mind. Hang up the seats to pick up the sea and the moon, ride the wind down Changchuan. Buy more Xinfeng醁, fully loaded with Shanxi boats. No one met on the way until Ermen. Laughing and getting drunk together, having fun for a lifetime."

After enjoying the drunkenness, he sent Cui Shiyu two poems.","On the ninth day, the cornel is ripe, and the wounds on the temples are prematurely whitened. Ascending to look at the mountains and the sea, the eyes are full of sadness. Visiting sand throwers from afar, because they escaped fame. Who is the old friend? Cui Tingbo is the only one. I don't know each other in Chongyang, and I can carry wine as I like. Holding a chrysanthemum in his hand, he made fun of two thousand stones. At dusk, I return to the bank, and call the pass. Tongyu double white deer, guest from He Huihe. The master was in the middle, and it was separated by clouds. Good day and beautiful scenery, two places are wasted.

There are four seats full of British bureaucrats, as bright as Qiong Linfu. The 鹢 head makes the scenery fall, and the eyebrows are decorated with pearls. The new string picks the pear orchard, and the ancient dance is charming Wu. The curvature circles around Yunhan, and the listeners are all happy. How noisy the chickens are, and the shengyu is boiling along the moon. The ancient emperor's palace garden is now Qiaosu. Feeling this persuasion, I hope you will cover the pot. Rongsheng is happy, and there is no order for future generations to appeal."
浪漫,李白,春日醉起言志,唐,处世若大梦，胡为劳其生。所以终日醉，颓然卧前楹。觉来盼庭前，一鸟花间鸣。借问此何时，春风语流莺。感之欲叹息，对酒还自倾。浩歌待明月，曲尽已忘情。,Romantic,Li Bai,Drunk in Spring,"Being in the world is like a big dream, and doing nothing to make a living. So drunk all day long, slumped in front of the bed. Feeling coming to look forward to the front of the court, a bird singing among flowers. May I ask when this is, the spring breeze speaks and flows.

Dandang Cangzhou clouds, floating Zixia thought. Dissecting the bamboo and Shangluo, the political intentions are already idle. Depression is born outside the world, and the porch is closed silently. I come to the Fang Festival, and I am happy when I untie the couch. The curtain is facing Yunfeng, and the sleeve is pointing to Songxue. Temporarily leave the edge of the east city, then swim in front of the west rock. There are towering emerald walls across the sky, and gullies are singing red springs. Searching for Youshu has not stopped, I love this spring. There are famous flowers beside the stream, and there is a beautiful moon on the stone. Ordered to drive back, Lu Huasheng green moss. It will be too late to drown in regret, and I will hear the ape's sorrow again. Clearing the ape breaks the heart, and the wanderer misses his hometown. Ming Fashou East Road, this joy can never be forgotten."

There is a well in the past, and there is a five-zhang bed underneath. The woodcutter washes her plain feet, and the passerby breaks off her golden clothes. Looking west at Bailuzhou, the reed flowers are like morning frost. Send you off at this time, looking back and crying."
浪漫,李白,洞庭醉后送绛州吕使君果流澧州,唐,昔别若梦中，天涯忽相逢。洞庭破秋月，纵酒开愁容。赠剑刻玉字，延平两蛟龙。送君不尽意，书及雁回峰。,Romantic,Li Bai,"After Dongting was drunk, he sent Lu Shijun of Jiangzhou to Lizhou","Farewell in the past is like a dream, and we meet suddenly at the end of the world.

Sending you off is not enough, the book and the wild goose return to the peak."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 独不见,唐,白马谁家子，黄龙边塞儿。天山三丈雪，岂是远行时。春蕙忽秋草，莎鸡鸣西池。风摧寒棕响，月入霜闺悲。忆与君别年，种桃齐蛾眉。桃今百馀尺，花落成枯枝。终然独不见，流泪空自知。,Romantic,Li Bai,Miscellaneous songs and lyrics alone,"Whose family is the white horse, the frontier fortress of Huanglong. Three feet of snow in the Tianshan Mountains, how can it be when traveling far. Chunhui suddenly autumn grass, Shaji crowing in the West Pool. The wind destroys the cold and the palm rings, and the moon enters the frost, and the boudoir is sad. Recalling the year of farewell to the king, planting peaches together. The peach is more than a hundred feet away, and the flowers have fallen into dead branches. In the end, I don't see alone, and I know nothing when I cry."

浪漫,李白,独酌,唐,春草如有意，罗生玉堂阴。东风吹愁来，白发坐相侵。独酌劝孤影，闲歌面芳林。长松尔何知，萧瑟为谁吟。手舞石上月，膝横花间琴。过此一壶外，悠悠非我心。,Romantic,Li Bai,drink alone,"If the spring grass is intentional, Luo Shengyu Tangyin. The east wind blows sorrow, white hair sits and invades each other. Drinking alone to persuade Gu Ying, singing leisurely to face Fanglin. How does Chang Songer know, who is Xiao Se singing for?

Thousands of gates are closed for autumn scenery, and Wan's surname is Wei Chaoshuang. Xian Xiangxie's vitality, and then Xinhai County Kang. There is a Kuilong in the Taiting, and there is a row of candy. Winged Sanyuan Sheng, shining two suns. It should be read under the raspberries, and the snow weeps and worships the sky."
浪漫,李白,相和歌辞 丁都护歌,唐,云阳上征去，两岸饶商贾。吴牛喘月时，拖船一何苦。水浊不可饮，壶浆半成土。一唱都护歌，心摧泪如雨。万人凿盘石，无由达江浒。君看石芒砀，掩泪悲千古。,Romantic,Li Bai,Xianghe Geci Ding Duhu Ge,"Yunyang went up to conquer, and the two sides of the strait were Rao merchants. When Wu Niu was panting for the moon, why bother with the tugboat. The water is turbid and undrinkable, and the pot of pulp is half made into soil. When I sang the song of Duhu, my heart burst into tears like rain. Thousands of people chisel rocks, but there is no way to reach Jianghu. You look at Shimangdang, hiding your tears and mourning through the ages."
浪漫,李白,相和歌辞 上留田,唐,行至上留田，孤坟何峥嵘。积此万古恨，春草不复生。悲风四边来，肠断白杨声。借问谁家地，埋没蒿里茔。古老向余言，言是上留田。蓬科马鬣今已平，昔之弟死兄不葬。他人于此举铭旌，一鸟死，百鸟鸣，一兽死，百兽惊。桓山之禽别离苦，欲去回翔不能征。田氏仓卒骨肉分，青天白日摧紫荆。交柯之木本同形，东枝憔悴西枝荣。无心之物尚如此，参商胡乃寻天兵。孤竹延陵，让国扬名。高风缅邈，颓波激清。尺布之谣，塞耳不能听。,Romantic,Li Bai,Xianghe Geci Kamiruta,"Walking to the top of Liutian, what is the solitary grave. Accumulating this eternal hatred, the spring grass will not regenerate. The sad wind blows from all directions, and the sound of poplars breaking their hearts. Ask whose land to bury the tomb in Artemisia. The ancients said to Yu that it was Shangliutian. The mane of Punta Koma is flat now, and the dead brothers of the past are not buried. When others put up the inscription, one bird dies, a hundred birds sing, one beast dies, and a hundred beasts startle. The birds in Huanshan are suffering from parting, and if they want to go back and fly, they can't be conquered. The Tian family hastily separated the flesh and blood, and the blue sky and the sun destroyed the Bauhinia. The trees of Jiaoke have the same shape, and the east branch is haggard and the west branch is flourishing. Unintentional things are still like this, and Hu Nai is looking for heavenly soldiers when he participates in business. Guzhu Yanling, let the country become famous. The wind is high, and the waves are clear. You can't listen to the rumor of the ruler cloth."

On the blue strips of plain hands, red makeup is fresh in the day. Silkworm hungry concubine wants to go, five horses don't linger."

In May, Xi Shi picks, people look at the pass as evil. Returning to the boat does not wait for a month, and returns to the Yuewang's house."
浪漫,李白,相和歌辞 门有车马客行,唐,门有车马客，金鞍曜朱轮。谓从丹霄落，乃是故乡亲。呼儿埽中堂，坐客论悲辛。对酒两不饮，停觞泪盈巾。叹我万里游，飘飖三十春。空谈霸王略，紫绶不挂身。雄剑藏玉匣，阴符生素尘。廓落无所合，流离湘水滨。借问宗党间，多为泉下人。生苦百战役，死托万鬼邻。北风扬胡沙，埋翳周与秦。大运且如此，苍穹宁匪仁。恻怆竟何道？存亡任大钧。,Romantic,Li Bai,There are carriages and horses at the gate of Xianghe Geci,"There are chariots and horses at the door, golden saddles and red wheels. It is said that falling from Danxiao is a hometown relative. In the middle hall of Huertun, sit on the guest and discuss the sorrow and hardship. If you don't drink wine, you will stop drinking and tear up your towel. Sigh, I have traveled thousands of miles, and I have been floating for thirty springs. Empty talk about the overlord's strategy, the purple ribbon does not hang on the body. The male sword is hidden in the jade box, and the yin talisman produces plain dust. There is nothing to do with the profile, drifting away from the Xiang River. Let me ask the sectarian party, most of them are from Quanxia. Life is full of hardships and battles, and death entrusts thousands of ghosts to neighbors. The north wind blows the Husha, burying Zhou and Qin. Not to mention the great luck, the sky is rather benevolent. What is the path of pity? Survival of Ren Dajun."
浪漫,李白,相和歌辞 乌栖曲,唐,姑苏台上乌栖时，吴王宫里醉西施。吴歌楚舞欢未毕，青山犹衔半边日。银箭金壶漏水多，起看秋月坠江波，东方渐高奈乐何。,Romantic,Li Bai,Xianghe Geci Wuqi Qu,"When Wu Qi was on the stage of Gusu, Xi Shi was drunk in the Wu Palace. The Wu song and Chu dance are not over yet, and the green hills still hold half the sun. The golden pot of silver arrows leaks a lot of water. It looks like the autumn moon falls on the river waves, and the east is getting higher and higher."
浪漫,李白,相和歌辞 公无渡河,唐,黄河西来决昆崙，咆吼万里触龙门。波滔天，尧咨嗟。大禹理百川，儿啼不窥家。杀湍湮洪水，九州始蚕麻。其害乃去，茫然风沙。被发之叟狂而痴，清晨径流欲奚为。旁人不惜妻止之，公无渡河苦渡之。虎可搏，河难凭。公果溺死流海湄，有长鲸白齿若雪山。公乎公乎，挂骨于其间，箜篌所悲竟不还。,Romantic,Li Bai,Xianghe Song Ci Gong Wu crossed the river,"The Yellow River comes west to conquer Kunlun, roaring thousands of miles to touch the dragon's gate. The waves are monstrous, and Yao Zi sighs. Dayu manages all rivers, but his son does not peek at the house. To kill the turbulent flood, Kyushu began to silkworm. The harm is to go, bewildered by the wind and sand. The old man who was sent out was crazy and insane, and he wanted to be ridiculed in the early morning runoff. Others don't hesitate to stop their wives, and the public has no way to cross the river. Tigers can be fought, but rivers are hard to follow. Gongguo drowned and flowed into the Mekong River, and there were long whales with white teeth like snow mountains. It's public and public, and the bones are hanging in it, and the sorrow of Konghou will not be returned."
浪漫,李白,相和歌辞 凤吹笙曲,唐,仙人十五爱吹笙，学得昆丘彩凤鸣。始闻鍊气餐金液，复道朝天赴玉京。玉京迢迢几千里，凤笙去去无边已。欲叹离声发绛唇，更嗟别调流纤指。此时惜别讵堪闻，此地相看未忍分。重吟真曲和清吹，却奏仙歌响绿云。绿云紫气向函关，访道应寻缑氏山。莫学吹笙王子晋，一遇浮丘断不还。,Romantic,Li Bai,Xiang He Ge Ci Feng Blowing Sheng Song,"Immortals like to play the sheng at fifteen, and they learned how to sing the phoenix in Kunqiu. Hearing that Lianqi eats gold liquid, he went to Yujing again. Yujing is thousands of miles away, and Fengsheng is boundless. Want to sigh from the sound of purple lips, and even sigh the flow of fine fingers. At this time, I can't bear to say goodbye to you, but I can't bear to see each other here. He chanted the real song and the Qing blowing again, but played the fairy song to ring the green clouds. Green clouds and purple air flow towards Hanguan, and you should find Goushi Mountain when you visit the road. Don't learn to blow the sheng prince Jin, and never return it when it encounters Fuqiu."
浪漫,李白,相和歌辞 凤凰曲,唐,嬴女吹玉箫，吟弄天上春。青鸾不独去，更有携手人。影灭彩云断，遗声落西秦。,Romantic,Li Bai,Xianghe Lyrics Phoenix Song,"Ying Nu plays the jade flute and recites the spring in the sky.

浪漫,李白,相和歌辞 日出入行,唐,日出东方隈，似从地底来。历天又入海，六龙所舍安在哉？其始与终古不息，人非元气安能与之久裴回。草不谢荣于春风，木不怨落于秋天。谁挥鞭策驱四运，万物兴歇皆自然。羲和羲和，汝奚汨没于荒淫之波。鲁阳何德？驻景挥戈。逆道违天，矫诬实多。吾将囊括大块，浩然与溟涬同科。,Romantic,Li Bai,Xianghe Geci Sunrise and Entrance,"The sunrise in the east seems to come from the ground. The sky has entered the sea again, where is the house of the six dragons? Its beginning and end are endless, and people who have no vitality can stay with them for a long time. The grass does not thank the spring breeze, and the wood does not complain about the autumn. Whoever swings the whip to drive the four lucks, everything will rise and fall naturally. Xihe Xihe, Ru Ximi was submerged in the wave of debauchery. Lu Yang He De? Live in the scene. Going against the way and going against the sky, there are many false accusations. I will cover the big chunks, Haoran and Ming Wei share the same discipline."
浪漫,李白,相和歌辞 王昭君二首 其二,唐,汉家秦地月，流影照明妃。一上玉关道，天涯去不归。汉月还从东海出，明妃西嫁无来日。燕支长寒雪作花，蛾眉憔悴没胡沙。生乏黄金枉图画，死留青冢使人嗟。,Romantic,Li Bai,Xianghe Geci Wang Zhaojun Two Poems,"Qin Diyue of the Han family, concubine of Liuying Lighting. As soon as you go up the Yuguan road, you will never return to the end of the world. The moon of Han is still out from the East China Sea, and the Ming concubine will marry west and have no future. The swallows grow cold and the snow makes flowers, and the moth eyebrows are haggard and there is no sand. Life lacks gold and pictures are in vain, and death leaves green graves to make people sigh."
浪漫,李白,相和歌辞 对酒二首 其一,唐,松子栖金华，安期入蓬海。此人古之仙，羽化竟何在？浮生速流电，倏忽变光彩。天地无凋换，容颜有迁改。对酒不肯饮，含情欲谁待。,Romantic,Li Bai,One of two poems about Xianghe's lyrics and wine,"Pine nuts live in Jinhua, and enter Penghai in peace. Where did this ancient immortal become immortal? Floating speed flowing current, suddenly changing brilliance. The world does not change, but the appearance changes. If you refuse to drink wine, whoever treats you if you have lust."
浪漫,李白,相和歌辞 对酒二首 其二,唐,劝君莫拒杯，春风笑人来。桃李如旧识，倾花向我开。流莺啼碧树，明月窥金罍。昨来朱颜子，今日白发催。棘生石虎殿，鹿走姑苏台。自古帝王宅，城阙闭黄埃。君若不饮酒，昔人安在哉。,Romantic,Li Bai,Xianghe Song Ci is the second of two poems about wine,"Advise the king not to refuse the cup, the spring breeze laughs at people. Peaches and plums are like old acquaintances, and they bloom to me. Flowing warbler sings green tree, and the bright moon peeps golden scorpion. Zhu Yanzi came to Zhu Yanzi yesterday, and today he has white hair to remind him. The thorns live in the Stone Tiger Palace, and the deer walks away from the Gusu Terrace. Since ancient times, the emperor's residence has been closed to Huangai. If you don't drink alcohol, the ancients will be safe."
浪漫,李白,相和歌辞 玉阶怨,唐,玉阶生白露，夜久侵罗袜。却下水精帘，玲珑望秋月。,Romantic,Li Bai,Xianghe Song Ci Yujie Resentment,"White dew is born on the jade steps, and the socks are invaded for a long time at night. But under the water fine curtain, Linglong looks at the autumn moon."
浪漫,李白,相和歌辞 白头吟二首 其二,唐,锦水东流碧，波荡双鸳鸯。雄巢汉宫树，雌弄秦草芳。相如去蜀谒武帝，赤车驷马生辉光。一朝再览大人作，万乘忽欲凌云翔。闻道阿娇失恩宠，千金买赋要君王。相如不忆贫贱日，官高金多聘私室。茂陵姝子皆见求，文君欢爱从此毕。泪如双泉水，行堕紫罗襟。五起鸡三唱，清晨白头吟。长吁不整绿云鬓，仰诉青天哀怨深。城崩杞梁妻，谁道土无心。东流不作西归水，落花辞枝羞故林。头上玉燕钗，是妾嫁时物。赠君表相思，罗袖幸时拂。莫卷龙须席，从他生网丝。且留琥珀枕，还有梦来时。鹔鹴裘在锦屏上，自君一挂无由披。妾有秦楼镜，照心胜照井。愿持照新人，双对可怜影。覆水却收不满杯，相如还谢文君回。古来得意不相负，祗今惟有青陵台。,Romantic,Li Bai,Xianghe Songci Baitouyin Two Poems,"Jinshui flows green in the east, and there are two mandarin ducks in waves. The male nests in the Han palace tree, and the female plays Qin Caofang. Xiangru went to Shu to pay homage to Emperor Wu, and the red chariot and four horses shone brightly. Once I look at the works of adults again, Wan Cheng suddenly wants to soar in the clouds. Hearing that Gillian fell out of favor, she bought a gift from the king with a thousand pieces of gold. Xiangru doesn't remember the poor and humble days, when officials, high-ranking and gold officials often hired private houses. All the Shuzi in Maoling saw and begged, and Wen Jun's love ended from then on. Tears are like double springs, falling into purple lapels. The chicken sings three times five times, and the white head sings in the morning. Long call out green cloud temples, look up to the blue sky and complain deeply. The wife of Qiliang in the collapse of the city has no heart. Flowing east does not make water returning to the west, falling flowers and branches make the old forest ashamed. The jade swallow hairpin on the head is a concubine's wedding gift. Give you a watch for lovesickness, and your sleeves will be brushed when you are lucky. Don't roll the dragon's beard mat, and make mesh from him. And keep the amber pillow, and when dreams come. The fur is on the Jinping, and there is no reason to wear it when you hang it. The concubine has Qin Loujing, who shines on the heart better than the well. May the newcomer who holds the photo be a pity for the couple. Covered with water but not enough to collect the cup, Xiangru also thanked Wenjun for returning. In ancient times, pride has not been negative, but now there is only Qinglingtai."
浪漫,李白,相和歌辞 阳春歌,唐,长安白日照春空，绿杨结烟桑袅风。披香殿前花始红，流芳发色绣户中。绣户中，相经过。飞燕皇后轻身舞，紫宫夫人绝世歌。圣君三万六千日，岁岁年年奈乐何。,Romantic,Li Bai,Xianghe Song Ci Yangchun Song,"The white sun shines in the spring sky in Chang'an, and the green poplars are smoky and windy. The flowers in front of the incense-piercing hall are red, and the fragrance is flowing and the color is embroidered in the household. In the embroidered household, we pass by each other. Empress Feiyan dances lightly, and Mrs. Zigong sings a masterpiece. The holy king has 36,000 days, and every year he is happy."
浪漫,李白,相和歌辞 估客行,唐,海客乘天风，将船远行役。譬如云中鸟，一去无踪迹。,Romantic,Li Bai,Xianghe Geci Marketer,"Sea passengers take advantage of the wind and sail the ship far away. Like a bird in the cloud, it disappears without a trace."
浪漫,李白,相和歌辞 君道曲,唐,大君若天覆，广运无不至。轩后爪牙常先太山稽，如心之使臂。小白鸿翼于夷吾，刘葛鱼水本无二。土扶可成墙，积德为厚地。,Romantic,Li Bai,Xianghe Geci Monarch Song,"If the majesty is overthrown by the sky, there will be no shortage of luck. Xuan's back minions are often in Taishanji first, like an arm of the heart. Xiaobai Hongyi Yu Yiwu, Liu Ge Yushui is the same. Soil support can form a wall, and accumulating virtue can form a solid land."
浪漫,李白,相和歌辞 来日大难,唐,来日一身，携粮负薪。道长食尽，苦口焦唇。今日醉饱，乐过千春。仙人相存，诱我远学。海陵三山，陆憩五岳。乘龙上三天，飞目瞻两角。授以神药，金丹满握。蟪蛄蒙恩，深愧短促。思填东海，彊衔一木。道重天地，轩师广成。蝉翼九五，以求长生。下士大笑，如苍蝇声。,Romantic,Li Bai,Xianghe Ge bids farewell to the disaster in the future,"In the future, I will be alone, with food and salary. The Taoist priest ate up his food, his mouth was bitter and his lips were scorched. Drunk and full today, happy for thousands of springs. Immortals coexist, tempting me to study far away. There are three mountains in Hailing, and five mountains in Luqi. Riding on a dragon for three days, flying to look at the two corners. Give the magic medicine, the golden elixir is full. Cricket crickets are blessed, deeply ashamed of shortness. Thinking of filling the East China Sea, hold a tree by force. Dao weighs heaven and earth, and Xuan masters make great achievements. Cicada's wings are ninety-five, in order to live forever. The corporal laughed like a fly."
浪漫,李白,相和歌辞 杨叛儿,唐,君歌杨叛儿，妾劝新丰酒。何许最关人，乌啼白门柳。乌啼隐杨花，君醉留妾家。博山炉中沈香火，双咽一气凌紫霞。,Romantic,Li Bai,Xianghe Ge Ci Yang Ren'er,"Junge Yang rebels, and my concubine advises Xinfeng wine. What is the most important person, Wuyi Baimenliu. Wuyi hides Yanghua, the king is drunk and stays at my concubine's house. The incense burns in the Boshan furnace, and Ling Zixia swallows her breath."
浪漫,李白,相和歌辞 采莲曲,唐,若耶溪边采莲女，笑隔荷花共人语。日照新妆水底明，风飘香袖空中举。岸上谁家游冶郎，三三五五映垂杨。紫骝嘶入落花去，见此踟蹰空断肠。,Romantic,Li Bai,Xianghe Song Ci Lian Qu,"Picking lotus girls by the Ruoye stream, laughing across the lotus and talking with others.

The lonely moon Canglang River is Hanqing, and the Big Dipper is scattered in Changgeng Ming Dynasty. Huaiyu is frosty at night with wine, and the golden well water on the jade bed is towering. Life is erratic within a hundred years, and it must be hearty and eternal. You can't let the raccoon anoint the golden distance to learn cockfighting, and let your breath blow the rainbow. You can't imitate brother Shu rampant Qinghai night with a knife, Xitu Shibao to take a purple robe. In the north window of reciting poems and composing Fu, ten thousand words can't make a glass of water. Everyone in the world turned their heads when they heard this, like the east wind hitting a horse's ear. Yumu also laughed at me, please be the same as Mingyue. You can't eat in the Hualiu boxing game, and the donkey will win the spring breeze. Folding Yang Huanghua and the current customs, Jin Jun listened to the piano in vain. Ba people who are willing to be with Yangchun, the origin of Chu is cheap Qipu. The gold is scattered and cannot be handed over, and the white head is treated lightly for Confucianism. Talking and laughing lose color, and the flies are full of slander. Zeng Shen is a murderer, slander three and a loving mother is frightened. Talk with the king and hold the king's hand, what is the honor and disgrace to the rest. Kong Sheng still heard that Fenglin was injured, and Dong Long was even more so. I have been proud and bitter all my life, but I am kind and good-looking. Yan Ling bowed high to the emperor of the Han Dynasty, why bother to stick a long sword on the jade steps. Being rich is not expensive enough, and being poor is not enough to be sad. Han Xin was ashamed to compare Jiang Guan, and Ni Heng was ashamed to drive Tu Gu'er away. Don't you see Li Beihai, where is the heroic spirit now? Don't you see Pei Shangshu, the earthen tomb is three feet away from Artemisia thorns. The young man had long wanted to go to the five lakes. Seeing this, Mi Jiang Zhong Dingshu."

The small things are ignorant of the distant map, but I would rather know the alchemist. Duojun Zixiaoyi, go to Cangshan alone. The earth is cold and the clouds are deep, the rocks are high and the wind is blowing. Climb Cuiwei Ridge for the first time, and rest at Jinsha Spring again. Practice the moss and slip towards the frost, and make waves and evening moons. Drink the other stone's dirty stream, and hang the smoke in the brook. Dinghu dreamed of lushui, and the dragon was at a loss. Go to Meridian Pass early, but the road to climb is far away. Flick the piano to listen to the frost ape, and extinguish the candle is the star meal. There is no clear difference in human habitation, and there is no way for birds to go back and forth. Climb the cliff and pour the blue sky, look down at day and night. After passing Shimenyin, I also sang Shitan songs. Wading through the snow and smelling Zifang, Zhuo Ying wants to clear the waves. This person is invisible, and the king is here to pass. For Yu Xie Fengquan, what is its meaning."
浪漫,李白,荅杜秀才五松见赠,唐,昔献长杨赋，天开云雨欢。当时待诏承明里，皆道扬雄才可观。敕赐飞龙二天马，黄金络头白玉鞍。浮云蔽日去不返，总为秋风摧紫兰。角巾东出商山道，采秀行歌咏芝草。路逢园绮笑向人，两君解来一何好。闻道金陵龙虎盘，还同谢朓望长安。千峰夹水向秋浦，五松名山当夏寒。铜井炎炉歊九天，赫如铸鼎荆山前。陶公瞿铄呵赤电，回禄睢盱扬紫烟。此中岂是久留处，便欲烧丹从列仙。爱听松风且高卧，飕飕吹尽炎氛过。登崖独立望九州，阳春欲奏谁相和。闻君往年游锦城，章仇尚书倒屣迎。飞笺洛绎奏明主，天书降问回恩荣。肮脏不能就圭组，至今空扬高蹈名。夫子工文绝世奇，五松新作天下推。吾非谢尚邀彦伯，异代风流各一时。一时相逢乐在今，袖拂白云开素琴，弹为三峡流泉音。从兹一别武陵去，去后桃花春水深。,Romantic,Li Bai,Presented by Du Xiucai and Wu Songjian,"In the past, Chang Yang Fu was presented, and the sky opened and the clouds and rains were happy. At that time, in the imperial edict Chengming, all of them were worthy of praise. The royal order bestows two heavenly horses on the flying dragon, and a white jade saddle with a golden head. Floating clouds cover the sun and never return, and the autumn wind always destroys the purple orchids. The horn scarf goes out of Shangshan Road in the east, and Caixiu travels to sing Zhicao. Lu Fengyuan smiled at people, how good it is for the two gentlemen to meet. Hearing that the Jinling dragon and tiger are on the plate, I also look at Chang'an with Xie Tiao. Thousands of peaks clip water to Qiupu, five famous mountains are cold in summer. The copper well burns for nine days, and it is as impressive as a tripod cast in front of Jingshan Mountain. Tao Gong Qushuo hehe Chidian, and returned to Lusui to raise purple smoke. Is it a place to stay for a long time, so I want to burn pills to follow the ranks of immortals. I like to listen to the wind in the pines, and I lie high, blowing away the flames. Climbing the cliff and looking at Kyushu independently, whoever wants to make peace in Yangchun. Wen Jun visited Jincheng in the past, and Zhang Qiu Shangshu came to welcome him. Feijian Luo Yi played the Ming Lord, and the heavenly scriptures came down to ask Enrong. Dirty can't be the Kyu group, so far it has been empty-handed. Master's work is unique, and Wusong's new work is popular all over the world. I would like to thank Shang for inviting Uncle Yan, and each generation will be romantic for a while. The joy of reuniting for a while is now, with sleeves brushing white clouds and playing a plain qin, playing the sound of flowing springs in the Three Gorges. From Ziyi to Wuling, after going there, the peach blossoms are spring and the water is deep."

Kuilong was born in response to the fate, and Kaiyuan swept away the atmosphere. The golden mirror is too small, and the end is arched in Qing Dynasty. The light dust gathers Songyue, and the empty point is full of bright meaning. Misleadingly waved the purple mud edict, offering to Qingyunji. Slander and confuse the heart of the British lord, and benevolent and sycophantic. Imitation wandering under the palace gate, sighing the passing of time. Before writing Zhongxuan poems, Jia Sheng's tears flowed first. Hanging sails on the autumn river is not made by clouds. Mountains and seas lean eastward, and hundreds of rivers are boundless. I, Yu Yizi, have been separated for more than a thousand years. Yunkuo Yingda dilute, with the wind away holding sleeves. Ascend the boat and look at the distant water, and suddenly see the Canglang. Where did Gaoshi come from? The boat is small and safe. The clothes are pure and ancient, and the articles are beautiful. Extending the introduction of hometown people, Feng Yi has not been replaced. Gu Houda speaks silently, but Quan Zi knows everything. It used to be Wuxinyun, and all of them stayed for this reason. Shuangping is easy to drift, but alone crane thinks sharply. Go to Xiaoxiang in the morning to pay homage to Emperor Cangwu."

Open the seal to know the distant meaning, and sail south quickly. Feng Shui is uncertain, turbulent or stagnant. Recalling that the new moon was born yesterday, the west eaves are like Qiong hooks. What is it like today? A broken mirror hangs in the clear autumn. Hate not three or five bright, Pinghu Pan Chengliu. Unexpectedly, there was no reason for this joy, and Wang Ziyou was madly killed. Baling is set far away, holding gifts to relieve people's worries."
浪漫,李白,荆门浮舟望蜀江,唐,春水月峡来，浮舟望安极。正是桃花流，依然锦江色。江色绿且明，茫茫与天平。逶迤巴山尽，摇曳楚云行。雪照聚沙雁，花飞出谷莺。芳洲却已转，碧树森森迎。流目浦烟夕，扬帆海月生。江陵识遥火，应到渚宫城。,Romantic,Li Bai,Jingmen floating boat looking at the Shu River,"When the Spring Moon Gorge comes, the floating boat looks at Anji. It is the peach blossom flow, still the color of Jinjiang. The river is green and bright, vast and balanced. Winding to the end of Bashan Mountain, swaying Chu Yunxing. The snow gathers sand geese, and the flowers fly out of the valley warbler. But Fangzhou has turned around, and the green trees are welcoming. Liumupu Yanxi, sailing sea moon birth. Jiangling knows the distant fire, and should go to Zhugong City."

The bones are accumulated into Baling, and the last words of Chu are heard. The three Miao countries are poor in water, and the Sanxiang Road is narrow in land. At the age of Yan, the sky is towering, and when the time is dangerous, people are withered. Thinking about returning to prevent chaos, going to the country to hurt the arms. At Fangqiu Ruins on Ying Road, Zhang Hua also fell. The wind is sad and the ape is howling, and the tree falls and Hongfei is early. The sun is hidden in the red sand in the west, and the moon is bright in the east city grass. The view of the Guanhe River is gone, and the fog should be swept away. Call Tian Kewen for a long time, and I will ask Cang Hao."
浪漫,李白,草书歌行,唐,少年上人号怀素，草书天下称独步。墨池飞出北溟鱼，笔锋杀尽中山兔。八月九月天气凉，酒徒词客满高堂。笺麻素绢排数厢，宣州石砚墨色光。吾师醉后倚绳床，须臾扫尽数千张。飘风骤雨惊飒飒，落花飞雪何茫茫。起来向壁不停手，一行数字大如斗。恍恍如闻神鬼惊，时时只见龙蛇走。左盘右蹙如惊电，状同楚汉相攻战。湖南七郡凡几家，家家屏障书题遍。王逸少，张伯英，古来几许浪得名。张颠老死不足数，我师此义不师古。古来万事贵天生，何必要公孙大娘浑脱舞。,Romantic,Li Bai,Cursive Songs,"The young master is called Huai Su, and his cursive script is called unique in the world. The ink pond flies out of the Beiming fish, and the stroke of the pen kills all the Zhongshan rabbits. In August and September, the weather is cold, and the hall is full of drunkards and poets. There are several boxes of paper, linen and silk, and Xuanzhou stone inkstones are colored and light. After my master was drunk, he leaned on the rope bed and swept away thousands of sheets in a short time. The wind and showers are frightening and rustling, and the falling flowers and snow are so vast. Get up and face the wall without stopping, a line of numbers is as big as a bucket. It's as if hearing ghosts and ghosts, and seeing dragons and snakes walking away from time to time. Left and right frown like lightning, like Chu and Han are fighting each other. There are several families in the seven counties of Hunan, and every family has barriers and books. Wang Yishao, Zhang Boying, how many waves got their names in ancient times. Zhang Dian's old age and death are not enough to count. I learn from this righteousness but not from the past. In ancient times, everything is expensive, so why do you need Aunt Gongsun to dance."
浪漫,李白,草创大还赠柳官迪,唐,天地为橐籥，周流行太易。造化合元符，交媾腾精魄。自然成妙用，孰知其指的。罗络四季间，绵微无一隙。日月更出没，双光岂云只。姹女乘河车，黄金充辕轭。执枢相管辖，摧伏伤羽翮。朱鸟张炎威，白虎守本宅。相煎成苦老，消铄凝津液。髣髴明窗尘，死灰同至寂。捣冶入赤色，十二周律历。赫然称大还，与道本无隔。白日可抚弄，清都在咫尺。北酆落死名，南斗上生籍。抑予是何者，身在方士格。才术信纵横，世途自轻掷。吾求仙弃俗，君晓损胜益。不向金阙游，思为玉皇客。鸾车速风电，龙骑无鞭策。一举上九天，相携同所适。,Romantic,Li Bai,Grassroots University also presented Liu Guandi,"The heaven and the earth are narrow, and the Zhou fashion is too easy. The combination of good fortune and Yuanfu makes the spirit of copulation rise. Nature becomes a magical effect, who knows what it means. There is no gap between the four seasons. The sun and the moon come and go again, but the two lights are just clouds. Girls ride on river carts, and the yokes are filled with gold. The executive pivot governs and destroys Yuhe. Zhu bird Zhang Yanwei, white tiger guards the house. Decoction becomes bitter and old, disappears and coagulates body fluid. Like the dust in the bright window, the dead ashes are at the same time silent. Pounded and smelted into red, twelve weeks of calendar. Impressively called Da Huan, there is no separation from the Tao. It can be fondled during the day, and Qingdu is within easy reach. Beifeng is named dead, and Nandou is born. Who is the restraint? I am in Fang Shige. Believe in talent and skill, the world is easy to throw away. I seek immortality and abandon customs, Jun Xiao wins and loses.

Returning to the roots and restoring Taisu, the group moves Xi Yuanhe. Yan Yan four real people, debate like waves. There is no time for communication, and Yang Mori has become a subject. When the master heard Luo chant, he praised his talents and solidified them. Enthusiasm for gold, long-time guest side wasted. The Tao can be sold in bundles, and the five treasures overflow the mountains and rivers. Advise you to return to Songqiu, drink and look forward to Tingke. If the three flowers have not yet fallen, they will come here by chance."

Peiran takes the sky to travel, alone to the lost place. Wei Hou inherited his name, and his family talked about Shecheng. Scroll Shu into Yuanhua, traces and ancient sages merge. Thirteen works on literature and history, swiping like a vibrator. Arguing against Tian Klang, heart Qilu Lianzi. Going west to Luoyuan in the Qing Dynasty is quite astonishing. Caixiu lies in the king's house, because she peeps into the gate of heaven. When I came to visit Songfeng, the feather guest He Shuangshuang. Bring moonlight in the morning, and stay in the window of the jade girl in the evening. The ghost valley is graceful and graceful, and the dragon pool is rushing down. The water of the Bian River floats in the east and visits me for three thousand miles. Yixing is full of Wu Yun, floating in Zhejiang Province. Waving between Hangyue and Zhangting, looking forward to the tide. The waves roll over the Haimen stone, and the clouds span the Tianji Mountains. The white horse drives the plain cart, and Lei Ben's face is horrified. I heard the beauty of Kuaiji from a distance, and I went to the river of Yeye. Thousands of valleys and thousands of rocks, in the towering mirror lake. The beauty is indescribable, and the splendor is full of river city. People travel by the moon, and boats travel in the air. Among them, I waited for a long time, and entered Shan to find Wang Xu. Read Cao E's stele with a smile, meditate on the yellow silk language. The rooftops are lit up all over the world, and the sun sets towards the Qing Dynasty. The five peaks turn to the moonlight, and the sound of pine trees in a hundred miles. Lingxi consults Yanyue, and Huading is super-huge. The stone beam spans the blue sky, and the side foot walks on the half moon. Suddenly Si Yongjia, not afraid of credit by sea. Hanging at Lihaiqiao, looking back at Akagi Xia. Chicheng is gradually disappearing, and the front of Guyu is still there. The water continues to flow through the ages, and the pavilion is empty with thousands of frost and moon. The rivers and valleys in Jinyun are difficult, but Shimen is the most impressive. There is a big dipper hanging on the waterfall, so there is no need for this water end. The walls are sprayed with plain snow, and the air is cold in the daytime. But I want to go to the evil stream, and I would rather fear the evil of the evil stream. Roaring seventy beaches, water and rocks are thin. Lutron Li Beihai, Yankai Xie Kangle. The wind of the pine and the sound of the ape search for the caves and gullies. Walk out of Plum Blossom Bridge, Shuangxi Naguichao. If the sail falls on the Jinhua shore, the red pine can be recruited. Shen Yue Bayong Tower, a lonely house in the west of the city. Outside the four wildernesses, I look forward to the Qunchuan Meeting. The clouds roll over the sky and the earth, and the wave connects with the West Zhejiang University. Turbulent flow at Xin'ankou, pointing to Yan Guangse in the north. Among the green clouds on Diaotai, Miao and Cangling are facing each other. After coming to Wudu for a while, Pei returned to Gusu. The smoke is endless and suspicious, and you can see the five lakes. The eyes are farther away, but the sad song is long. Go back to the riverside of Chu River and wave the Yangzijin. Dressed in Japanese fur, Ang hides the wind and dust. Create my language in May, and know that it is not a person. The joy of reunion is infinite, and the water and stone are always in sight. Doing nothing to the five princes will not result in a hundred gold production. My friend Yang Ziyun, string songs sow Qingfen. Although he is slaughtered by Jiangning, he likes to be with monkeys. Take pleasure in one line, and know that I love you. When you come, Sendai should be there. The green jade tree in the east window has three or five branches. To today's altar people, it's too late to laugh at you. I regret the farewell, and my heart is sad at a loss. If the Yellow River does not stop, the white head will be longing for Acacia."

The scenic spot is passed down from generation to generation, and you call yourself beautiful when you go to Nanzhong.

Yishi is full of dragons, but the middle stage is demolished three times. The perfect man is a sign of opportunity, and he bows to the uncle of Kyushu. But between the world and the earth, he is a hidden guest. The noble way can be true, and the latent brilliance lies in the secluded neighbor. Explore the Yuan and enter the silence, and observe the boundless travel. Guangwu has the world, and Yanling is an old friend. Although ascended Luoyang Palace, unyielding nest by the body. Yu also thanked Mingzhu, who is now called Yan Jianchen. Ascend to see the eternity, think and become neighbors with Guang.

As soon as it sings for a long time, it looks like a dragon walking like a cloud. A strong man has a long-term strategy, and his ambition is to solve the world.

At that time, there was Tai Domes, and the Beijing Congress had tassel hairpins. The mountain seedlings fall to the bottom of the stream, and the secluded pines come out of the tall cen. The master has great talent, and the master gets Qiulin. Flowing water is not a Zheng song, and you will meet your bosom friend when you go forward. The garment worker cuts Qixiu, and accidentally injures a thousand pieces of gold. He cherishes the sword and does not cut the quilt of cold women. I am not a person who plays the crown, but I am open-fronted. There is no white horse in the empty valley, how can a wise man mourn.

Before entering the palace of the king of Wu, the ancient stone of Huansha was still there. The peaches and plums are newly opened in Yinggucha, and the calamus is still short out of Pingsha.

I laughed at Mr. Xue, and Hu Wei traveled between the two places. Gold is popular, but white jade is hard to vote for. The phoenix tree grows terrestris, and the green bamboo lacks fruit. The Phoenix stayed in someone's house, so he went with a group of chickens. The Tian family takes care of the horses, and the poor return to their families. For those who smile and turn away, the guests go to the plains. But he beheaded the beauty, and the three thousand were returned to Junben. Mao Gong held out his sword, Chu and Zhao coexisted.

Analysis on the evening journey, take advantage of whatever suits you. The servant is at Yanmen Pass, and the king is a guest of Emei. The heart hangs thousands of miles away, and the shadow lags behind the two towns. The long sword returned and met Luoyang Mo. Any noise on the street is disturbing. Feeling lost in the maze, the momentum turns with the wind. Thanks to Chaolie, I will return to my hometown with a long roar. The hometown is leisurely and leisurely, seeking ancient scattered and ethereal. I want to enter a famous mountain for a long time, but the marriage is not over yet. There are many beliefs in life, and there is only one thing in the world. Thinking of this, I feel like burning with worry, feeling as if I have lost something. I heard that the king was lying on the stone gate, and I lived in the past with Nathan. Fang hides from the osmanthus tree, not envious of the peach blossom garden.

Although you travel in Daolin room, you also hold Tao Qian's cup. Qingle moves the heavens, and Changsong sings its own mourning. If you can stay happy, the robbery will turn into ashes."
浪漫,李白,商山四皓,唐,白发四老人，昂藏南山侧。偃卧松雪间，冥翳不可识。云窗拂青霭，石壁横翠色。龙虎方战争，于焉自休息。秦人失金镜，汉祖升紫极。阴虹浊太阳，前星遂沦匿。一行佐明圣，倏起生羽翼。功成身不居，舒卷在胸臆。窅冥合元化，茫昧信难测。飞声塞天衢，万古仰遗则。,Romantic,Li Bai,Shangshan Sihao,"The four white-haired old men are on the side of the South Mountain. Lying in the pine and snow, the darkness is unrecognizable. The cloud window blows the green mist, and the stone wall is green. When the dragon and the tiger fight, Yu Yan rests on his own. The people of Qin lost the golden mirror, and the ancestors of Han rose to Ziji. When the rainbow turbids the sun, the former star disappears. A group of Zuo Mingsheng suddenly raised their wings. When you are successful, you don't live in your body, and you feel relaxed in your chest. The combination of the dark and the dark, the vague and unpredictable. The sound of flying fills the sky, and it is the rule of looking up forever."
浪漫,李白,宿无相寺,唐,头陀悬万仞，远眺望华峰。聊借金沙水，洗开九芙蓉。烟岚随遍览，踏屐走双龙。明日登高去，山僧孰与从？禅床今暂歇，枕月卧青松。更尽闻呼鸟，恍来报晓钟。,Romantic,Li Bai,Su Wuxiang Temple,"Toutuo hangs ten thousand feet, overlooking Huafeng from a distance. Talk about borrowing the golden sand water to wash away the nine hibiscus. The smoke and haze can be seen everywhere, and the double dragons can be stepped on. Tomorrow, when I climb up the mountain, who will follow the mountain monk? The Zen bed is temporarily resting, resting on the moon and lying on the green pine. Hearing the call of the bird, he suddenly came to announce the dawn bell."
浪漫,李白,宿虾湖,唐,鸡鸣发黄山，暝投虾湖宿。白雨映寒山，森森似银竹。提携采铅客，结荷水边沐。半夜四天开，星河烂人目。明晨大楼去，冈陇多屈伏。当与持斧翁，前溪伐云木。,Romantic,Li Bai,Shrimp Lake,"The rooster crows and sends out Huangshan, and the shrimp lake stays in the dark. The white rain reflects the cold mountain, dense like silver bamboo. Help the lead collectors and bathe by the lotus water. Open four days in the middle of the night, the star river is dead. Going to the building in the morning, Ganglong is more crouching. When you are with the axe-wielding old man, cut cloud trees in front of the stream."
浪漫,李白,宿清溪主人,唐,夜到清溪宿，主人碧岩里。檐楹挂星斗，枕席响风水。月落西山时，啾啾夜猿起。,Romantic,Li Bai,Master of Su Qingxi,"At night, I went to Qingxi to stay in Biyanli, the owner. Stars are hung on the eaves, and Fengshui is heard on the pillow mat. When the moon sets on the western mountain, the chirping night ape rises."

I personally saw Mr. Anqi eat jujubes as big as melons. In the middle age, he paid homage to the Lord of the Han Dynasty, and returned home if he was not satisfied. Zhu Yan Xie Chunhui, white hair sees life. The golden liquid is what you expect, and you can fly to the cloud car. I would like to follow my master on the altar of heaven and sweep the fallen flowers with the immortals."

When we met on the river, I asked the king, and the wind blew before the laughter was over. Wenjun brings prostitutes to visit his lover, so he should be disregarding his own life for Shangshu. There are three thousand pearls in the hall, and a hundred Dendrobium Jinlingchun in the urn. Hate me for stopping this joy and drowning in Chu Riverside. The moonlight is drunk from afar, and the mountain flowers are blooming. Spring Breeze kills people like crazy, one day drama for three years. It was too late, so he burned his son's boat. Dreaming of five willow branches is worthy of a horsewhip. When will you arrive in Pengze, sing a long song before Tao Ling."

My family sends it to Donglu, who grows Guiyintian. Spring is too late, Jiang Xingfu is at a loss. The south wind blows back to the heart, flying down in front of the restaurant. There is a peach tree in the east of the building, the branches and leaves blowing green smoke. I planted this tree, don't come for three years. The peach is now in the same room as the building, and we have not yet moved on. The character of the charming girl is Pingyang, with folded flowers leaning against the edge of the peach. I can't see me when I fold flowers, and my tears flow like a spring. The child's name is Boqin, and he is shoulder to shoulder with his elder sister. Under the two-row peach tree, who caresses the back? After reading this lost order, the liver and intestines will be fried day by day. The split element writes far away, because of Wenyangchuan."

Live in Lumen for life, not in Xiangyang City. The husband plays with the bright moon, and the scenery is cleared in the Huaihe River.

Wait for me to leave the world and visit pine nuts hand in hand."

A broken heart is like cutting a string, it is like worrying about what to think. I know from a distance that in the jade window, I can make clouds with my hands.

Line after line, the paper is full of love. There is a yellow crane in Yaotai, who is from the brothel. The red face is withered, and the white hair is new.

浪漫,李白,寄远十一首 其八,唐,忆昨东园桃李红碧枝，与君此时初别离。金瓶落井无消息，令人行叹复坐思。坐思行叹成楚越，春风玉颜畏销歇。碧窗纷纷下落花，青楼寂寂空明月。两不见，但相思，空留锦字表心素，至今缄愁不忍窥。,Romantic,Li Bai,Send far eleven out of eight,"Recalling the peaches, plums, red and bizhis in the East Garden yesterday, I parted from you for the first time at this time. There is no news of the gold bottle falling into the well, which makes people sigh and think again. Sitting thinking and sighing into Chuyue, the spring breeze and beautiful face are afraid of being sold out. Flowers are falling on the blue windows, and the brothel is silent and empty with a bright moon. I don't see each other, but I miss each other, leaving the brocade word in the air to express my heart, and I still can't bear to peep at it."

Lianjun Bingyu's clear heart, the love is not extreme, and the meaning is already deep. In the morning, we share the delicious food of Langgan, and at night we share the brocade quilt of mandarin ducks. The kindness is gentle and sudden, so that people don't get confused and worried. Disorderly worry, tears like snow, cold lamp tired of dreams. I feel that lovesickness gives birth to white hair, and the Yingying Han River can be crossed. It's a pity that Lingbo wears socks, beautiful women and beautiful women come back, don't fly to the balcony in the morning clouds and evening rain."
浪漫,李白,崔秋浦柳少府,唐,秋浦旧萧索，公庭人吏稀。因君树桃李，此地忽芳菲。摇笔望白云，开帘当翠微。时来引山月，纵酒酣清晖。而我爱夫子，淹留未忍归。,Romantic,Li Bai,Cui Qiupu Liu Shaofu,"Qiupu is old and desolate, with few officials in the court.

浪漫,李白,惧谗,唐,二桃杀三士，讵假剑如霜。众女妒蛾眉，双花竞春芳。魏姝信郑袖，掩袂对怀王。一惑巧言子，朱颜成死伤。行将泣团扇，戚戚愁人肠。,Romantic,Li Bai,Fear of slander,"Two peaches kill three soldiers, and the fake sword is like frost. All the girls are jealous of the moth eyebrows, and the double flowers are competing for spring fragrance. Wei Shu believed in Zheng Xiu, and covered her sleeves with King Huai.

浪漫,李白,望庐山瀑布水二首 其一,唐,西登香炉峰，南见瀑布水。挂流三百丈，喷壑数十里。歘如飞电来，隐若白虹起。初惊河汉落，半洒云天里。仰观势转雄，壮哉造化功。海风吹不断，江月照还空。空中乱潨射，左右洗青壁。飞珠散轻霞，流沫沸穹石。而我乐名山，对之心益闲。无论漱琼液，还得洗尘颜。且谐宿所好，永愿辞人间。,Romantic,Li Bai,Wanglushan Waterfall is the first of two,"Deng Xianglu Peak in the west, see the waterfall in the south. The hanging current is three hundred feet long, and the gully is dozens of miles away. It's like a flying electricity, and it's like a white rainbow. At the beginning of the shock, the river fell, and half of it was scattered in the sky. Looking up at the situation and turning the hero, it is a magnificent work of good fortune. The sea breeze blows constantly, and Jiang Yuezhao is still empty. Shooting randomly in the air, washing the green walls left and right. The flying beads disperse the light clouds, and the foam boils the dome stone. And I am happy with the famous mountain, and my heart is free. Regardless of gargling Qiongye, you have to wash your face. And the harmonious place is good, and I am willing to die forever."
浪漫,李白,望终南山寄紫阁隐者,唐,出门见南山，引领意无限。秀色难为名，苍翠日在眼。有时白云起，天际自舒卷。心中与之然，托兴每不浅。何当造幽人，灭迹栖绝巘。,Romantic,Li Bai,Wang Zhong Nanshan Sends Purple Pavilion Hermit,"Going out to see Nanshan is boundless. The beauty is hard to name, and the green sun is in sight. Sometimes white clouds rise, and the sky unwinds by itself. Consistent with it in my heart, Tuoxing is not shallow. Why create a secluded person, destroying traces and habitats."
浪漫,李白,望黄鹤山,唐,东望黄鹤山，雄雄半空出。四面生白云，中峰倚红日。岩峦行穹跨，峰嶂亦冥密。颇闻列仙人，于此学飞术。一朝向蓬海，千载空石室。金灶生烟埃，玉潭秘清谧。地古遗草木，庭寒老芝朮。蹇予羡攀跻，因欲保闲逸。观奇遍诸岳，兹岭不可匹。结心寄青松，永悟客情毕。,Romantic,Li Bai,Looking at Huanghe Mountain,"Looking east at Huanghe Mountain, Xiongxiong came out in mid-air. There are white clouds all around, and the middle peak leans against the red sun. The rocks and mountains line across the dome, and the peaks and peaks are also dense. It is quite heard that there are immortals who learn flying skills here. As soon as it faces Penghai, there is an empty stone chamber for thousands of years. The golden stove produces smoke, and the Yutan is secret and quiet. The grass and trees left by the ancient earth, the old sesame technique of Tinghan. Jian Yuxian climbed up, because he wanted to keep his leisure. Viewing wonders all over the mountains, this mountain is unmatched. Send the green pine with your heart, and realize the love of the guest forever."
浪漫,李白,望鹦鹉洲怀祢衡,唐,魏帝营八极，蚁观一祢衡。黄祖斗筲人，杀之受恶名。吴江赋鹦鹉，落笔超群英。锵锵振金玉，句句欲飞鸣。鸷鹗啄孤凤，千春伤我情。五岳起方寸，隐然讵可平。才高竟何施，寡识冒天刑。至今芳洲上，兰蕙不忍生。,Romantic,Li Bai,Wang Yingwuzhou Huai Miheng,"Emperor Wei camped at the eight poles, and the ants watched one Miheng. Huang Zu fought against Tau people, and he was notorious for killing them. Wu Jiang Fu parrot, the writing is super-heroic. Qiang Qiang vibrates gold and jade, every sentence wants to fly. The osprey of prey pecks at the lonely phoenix, Qianchun hurts my feelings. The five mountains start from a square inch, but they can be leveled implicitly. If you are talented, what can you do? If you are ignorant, you will be punished by heaven. So far on Fangzhou, Lan Hui can't bear to live."
浪漫,李白,梁园吟,唐,我浮黄云去京阙，挂席欲进波连山。天长水阔厌远涉，访古始及平台间。平台为客忧思多，对酒遂作梁园歌。却忆蓬池阮公咏，因吟渌水扬洪波。洪波浩荡迷旧国，路远西归安可得。人生达命岂暇愁，且饮美酒登高楼。平头奴子摇大扇，五月不热疑清秋。玉盘杨梅为君设，吴盐如花皎白雪。持盐把酒但饮之，莫学夷齐事高洁。昔人豪贵信陵君，今人耕种信陵坟。荒城虚照碧山月，古木尽入苍梧云。粱王宫阙今安在？枚马先归不相待。舞影歌声散绿池，空馀汴水东流海。沈吟此事泪满衣，黄金买醉未能归。连呼五白行六博，分曹赌酒酣驰辉。歌且谣，意方远，东山高卧时起来，欲济苍生未应晚。,Romantic,Li Bai,Liang Yuanyin,"go to Jingque in a yellow cloud, and I want to enter Bolian Mountain. The sky is long, the water is wide and the water is wide, and we are tired of traveling far, visiting the ancient times and the platforms. The platform is full of worries and thoughts for the guests, so they compose Liang Yuan songs about the wine. However, he recalled the chanting of Ruan Gong in Pengchi, because he chanted the flood of Lushui. Hong Bo is mighty and fascinated by the old country, and it is possible to return to safety in the far west. There is no time to worry about life, and drink fine wine to climb high buildings. The flat-headed slave shakes his big fan, May is not hot and doubts Qingqiu. The jade plate of bayberry is set for the king, and Wu Yan is like flowers and white snow. Hold the salt and drink the wine, don't learn from the barbarians and do things noble and pure. In the past, Lord Xinling was rich and noble, but now people cultivate the tomb of Xinling. The deserted city illuminates the blue mountains and the moon, and all the ancient trees enter the Cangwu clouds. Where is the Liang Palace Que now? The horses return first and don't wait for each other. Dancing shadows and singing are scattered in the green pool, and the spare water flows eastward into the sea. I meditate on this matter and tear up my clothes, but I can't return to gold after getting drunk. Repeatedly call five whites and six games, and share Cao's gambling on wine. Songs and ballads, the meaning is far away, when Dongshan is lying high, it is not too late to help the common people."
浪漫,李白,梁甫吟,唐,长啸梁甫吟，何时见阳春。君不见朝歌屠叟辞棘津，八十西来钓渭滨。宁羞白发照清水，逢时吐气思经纶。广张三千六百钓，风期暗与文王亲。大贤虎变愚不测，当年颇似寻常人。君不见高阳酒徒起草中，长揖山东隆准公。入门不拜骋雄辩，两女辍洗来趋风。东下齐城七十二，指挥楚汉如旋蓬。狂客落魄尚如此，何况壮士当群雄。我欲攀龙见明主，雷公砰訇震天鼓。帝傍投壶多玉女，三时大笑开电光。倏烁晦冥起风雨，阊阖九门不可通。以额扣关阍者怒，白日不照吾精诚。杞国无事忧天倾，䝟貐磨牙竞人肉。驺虞不折生草茎，手接飞猱搏彫虎。侧足焦原未言苦，智者可卷愚者豪。世人见我轻鸿毛，力排南山三壮士，齐相杀之费二桃。吴楚弄兵无剧孟，亚夫咍尔为徒劳。梁甫吟，梁甫吟，声正悲。张公两龙剑，神物合有时。风云感会起屠钓，大人?屼当安之。,Romantic,Li Bai,Liang Fuyin,"Chang Xiao Liang Fuyin, when will I see Yangchun. Don't you see Chaoge Tusou resigned from Jijin, and came to fish Weibin in the west at eighty. Ning's shameful white hair shines in the clear water, exhaling and thinking about economics every time. There are 3,600 fishes in Guangzhang, and the wind is dark with King Wen. Daxianhu became stupid and unexpected, and he looked like an ordinary person back then. Don't you see that Gaoyang drunkard is drafting, and he bows to Duke Longzhun of Shandong. If you don't ask for eloquence at the beginning, the two women will stop washing to catch up with the wind. Qicheng seventy-two in the east, commanding Chu and Han like a swirl. It's still the same for a lunatic, let alone a strong man who is a hero. I want to climb the dragon to see the Lord of Ming, but Lei Gong is rumbling and shaking the drums of the sky. The emperor threw a pot of jade girls by the side of the emperor, and laughed at three o'clock. The wind and rain flickered in the dark, and the nine gates were closed and closed. Those who buckle the gate with the forehead are angry, and the daylight does not shine on my sincerity. The state of Qi has nothing to worry about, and the gnats grind their teeth and compete for human flesh. Zou Yu does not break the stems of the grass, but catches the flying pigs and fights the carved tigers. Jiao Yuan with his side foot did not say it was bitter, but a wise man can win a fool's pride. The world saw that I was light on feathers, and fought against the three heroes of Nanshan, and Fei Ertao was the one who killed them all. Wu and Chu fought without drama, and Yavhal was in vain. Liang Fuyin, Liang Fuyin, the voice is sad. Zhang Gong's two dragon swords, when the gods and objects are combined. Feelings of wind and cloud will cause slaughter and fishing, my lord? You should be safe."
浪漫,李白,梦游天姥吟留别,唐,海客谈瀛洲，烟涛微茫信难求。越人语天姥，云霓明灭或可睹。天姥连天向天横，势拔五岳掩赤城。天台四万八千丈，对此欲倒东南倾。我欲因之梦吴越，一夜飞度镜湖月。湖月照我影，送我至剡溪。谢公宿处今尚在，渌水荡漾清猿啼。脚著谢公屐，身登青云梯。半壁见海日，空中闻天鸡。千岩万转路不定，迷花倚石忽已暝。熊咆龙吟殷岩泉，慄深林兮惊层巅。云青青兮欲雨，水澹澹兮生烟。列缺霹雳，丘峦崩摧。洞天石扇，訇然中开。青冥浩荡不见底，日月照耀金银台。霓为衣兮风为马，云之君兮纷纷而来下。虎鼓瑟兮鸾回车，仙之人兮列如麻。忽魂悸以魄动，恍惊起而长嗟。惟觉时之枕席，失向来之烟霞。世间行乐亦如此，古来万事东流水。别君去时何时还，且放白鹿青崖间，须行即骑访名山。安能摧眉折腰事权贵？使我不得开心颜。,Romantic,Li Bai,sleepwalking tianmu chanting farewell,"Haike talks about Yingzhou, Yantao is faint and letter is hard to find. Yue people speak Tianmu, and the clouds and neonates can be seen or dimmed. Tianmu stretches toward the sky, pulls out the five mountains to cover Chicheng. The rooftop is 48,000 feet long, and it is about to fall to the southeast. I want to fly to the mirror lake and moon overnight because of my dream Wuyue. The lake moon shines on my shadow and sends me to Shanxi. Xie Gong's residence is still there today, and the Lushui is rippling and the apes are singing. Wear Xie Gong clogs and climb the Qingyun Ladder. Seeing the sun on the half wall, smelling chickens in the sky. Thousands of rocks turn around and the road is uncertain, and the lost flowers lean on the stone and it is suddenly dark. The bear roars and the dragon chants Yin Yanquan, and the deep chestnut forest surprises the top of the layer. The clouds are green and green, and there is rain, and the water is dull, and there is smoke. There is a lack of thunderbolt, and the hills and mountains collapse. The stone fan in the cave opened in the middle. The Qingming mighty bottomless, the sun and the moon shine on Jinyintai. Ni is the clothes, the wind is the horse, and the king of clouds is coming and going. The tiger drums and the luan return to the carriage, and the immortals are lined up like hemp. Suddenly the soul palpitates with the soul, suddenly starts and sighs. I only feel the pillow mat of time, and lose the haze that came before. The same is true for worldly pleasures. Since ancient times, everything has flowed eastward. Don't return when you go, and put the white deer among the green cliffs, and ride to visit famous mountains as soon as you have to go. Can An Neng smash his eyebrows and bend his waist to serve the powerful? Makes me unhappy."
浪漫,李白,淮阴书怀寄王宗成,唐,沙墩至梁苑，二十五长亭。大舶夹双橹，中流鹅鹳鸣。云天扫空碧，川岳涵馀清。飞凫从西来，适与佳兴并。眷言王乔舄，婉娈故人情。复此亲懿会，而增交道荣。沿洄且不定，飘忽怅徂征。暝投淮阴宿，欣得漂母迎。斗酒烹黄鸡，一餐感素诚。予为楚壮士，不是鲁诸生。有德必报之，千金耻为轻。缅书羁孤意，远寄棹歌声。,Romantic,Li Bai,Letter from Huaiyin to Wang Zongcheng,"From Shadun to Liangyuan, there are twenty-five long pavilions. The big ship holds double sculls, and the mid-stream geese and storks cry. The sky and the sky are clear, and the mountains and rivers are clear. Flying mallards come from the west, suitable for merging with Jiaxing. The favored words Wang Qiaoxie, tactfully flirt with old people. Restore this pro-Yi meeting, and increase friendship with Dao Rong. Along the whirling and indeterminate, erratic and melancholy. I voted in Huaiyin in the dark, and I was glad to welcome the floating mother. Cooking yellow chicken with fighting wine, a meal is simple and sincere. I am a strong man of Chu, not Lu Zhusheng. Virtue must be repaid, and shame is light. The Burmese book restrains the lonely intention, and sends the singing of the oar from afar."
浪漫,李白,淮南卧病书怀寄蜀中赵徵君蕤,唐,吴会一浮云，飘如远行客。功业莫从就，岁光屡奔迫。良图俄弃损，衰疾乃绵剧。古琴藏虚匣，长剑挂空壁。楚冠怀钟仪，越吟比庄舄。国门遥天外，乡路远山隔。朝忆相如台，夜梦子云宅。旅情初结缉，秋气方寂历。风入松下清，露出草间白。故人不可见，幽梦谁与适。寄书西飞鸿，赠尔慰离析。,Romantic,Li Bai,Huainan sick letter sent to Zhao Zhengjun in Shuzhong,"Wu Hui is like a floating cloud, floating like a traveler from afar. There is no way to make achievements, and the time is rushing repeatedly. Good pictures are discarded, but decline and disease are continuous dramas. The guqin is hidden in the empty box, and the long sword is hung on the empty wall. Chu Guan is pregnant with Zhongyi, and he sings more and more than Zhuang Xi. The gate of the country is far away from the sky, and the roads of the country are separated by mountains. The memory of the court is like a stage, and the night dream is a cloud house. At the beginning of the travel love, the autumn air is lonely. The wind enters the Matsushita clear, exposing Kusama White. The old man is invisible, who is suitable for Youmeng. Send a book to Xifeihong, and give you comfort and separation."

Let me ask Xin'anjiang to find out why this is the case. In the mirror of pedestrians, in the screen of birds. The orangutan crowed in the evening, and Kong mourned the wanderer far away."

Knowing what is wrong at fifty, the ancients have tasted it. If you make up for your mistakes, you will live forever. Bao Huang hides flaws, and accumulates this stubborn ugliness. The moon rises to ridicule and shame the head. It was too late to realize it, and things have changed over time. Bai Bi He Gu, the bluebottle flies repeatedly. The group lightly folds the axis and sinks into Huangquan. All the hairs and bones fly up to the sky. The luxuriant phoenix is dark, and the shell is bright. The mud and sand gather together, and the pearls and jades are not fresh. Hongyan shone on the mountain, from Xianyan. The blue waves sway the sun, starting from the slight trickle. Disturbed the four kingdoms and spread in Baxun. Pick up the dust and pick up the bees, doubt the sage and guess the virtuous. Alas! Whoever observes the chastity. The madness of that woman is not as strong as the magpie. The woman's obscenity is not as good as that of a quail. A magnanimous gentleman has nothing to say. Continuing the crime of promoting hair is the crime of Kong Duo. To pour the sea into evil, there is no such thing as evil. Life is really difficult, weaving Luo every now and then. Destroy and burn money, and sing songs in sorrow. The day is not mourning, what about the rest. Daji destroys Zhou, and praises women to confuse Zhou. The heavenly dimension is in turmoil, and this is the reason. The Lu family, the ancestor of the Han Dynasty, eats it by his side. The Empress Dowager of Qin was also promiscuous. The gnats became faint, so they covered the sun. Ten thousand rides are still in Er, how can a man hurt. Resigned from the deep heart and poor, sincere and straightforward. If you talk in vain, Haotian is dead. Ziye is good at listening, from Lou to Ming. The gods escape from the sound, and the ghosts cannot escape. If I don't give up, I will be loyal."

Long strips of green smoke spread around hundreds of feet. The boudoir, Fei Sushou, picks and arrests and makes 絺绤. Sew it into a national garment, and send it to customers in Japan. When the Cangwu fire falls, don't throw away the summer clothes lightly. Although this object is outdated, it is in the hands of a concubine."
浪漫,李白,博平郑太守自庐山千里相寻入江夏北市门见访却之武陵立马赠别,唐,大梁贵公子，气盖苍梧云。若无三千客，谁道信陵君。救赵复存魏，英威天下闻。邯郸能屈节，访博从毛薛。夷门得隐沦，而与侯生亲。仍要鼓刀者，乃是袖槌人。好士不尽心，何能保其身。多君重然诺，意气遥相托。五马入市门，金鞍照城郭。都忘虎竹贵，且与荷衣乐。去去桃花源，何时见归轩。相思无终极，肠断朗江猿。,Romantic,Li Bai,"Zheng Taishou of Boping searched for a thousand miles from Lushan Mountain and went to Jiangxia North City Gate to meet him, but Wuling immediately bid farewell","The noble son of Daliang is full of clouds. If there are no three thousand guests, who will believe in Lord Ling. Rescue Zhao Fucun Wei, Yingwei world heard. Handan can bend the festival, visit Bo from Mao Xue. Yimen had to go into hiding and be married to Hou. Those who still want to play the sword are the people with the sleeve mallet. If a good man is not dedicated, how can he protect himself? Duojun respects his promise, and his spirit is far away. Five horses enter the city gate, and the golden saddle shines on the city wall. They all forget that tigers and bamboos are expensive, and they are happy with lotus clothes. Go to Taohuayuan, when will I see Guixuan. Lovesickness has no end, heartbroken Langjiang ape."

King Wu didn't hesitate in the past, he cut his claws and threw himself into the river. When a sage encounters slander, it is inevitable that people will be suspicious. The wind pulls out the big trees, and the millet is salty and wilted. Guan Cai fans the flies, and the public writes owl poems. If the golden scorpion is not opened, who will be loyal and trustworthy will know it."

Fortunately, I met the Lord of the Holy Spirit, and I owe you all the blessings of the clouds and rains. Back to the rest of the time, idleness is the past. But when it comes to mountains and seas, it seems like forests and valleys exist. Thinking of Xiaoyue in Minghu Lake, recalling the clear ape in overlapping peaks. Why return to the first clothes, the fields are drunk with Fangzun."

Thinking of sable fur in May, it is said that autumn frost falls. Stone radish leads to ancient vines, and shore bamboo shoots open new sheaths. Yinwan Kongfuqing, Acacia's masterpiece. Zheng Gong's poet is beautiful, and his rhyme is magnificent. When you come to visit, I am satisfied with Snow Mountain Nuo."

Six dragons pass through myriad ravines, and ravines and valleys linger back and forth. The trail of horses circles Bifeng, which is now covered with moss. Flying and shedding, the water is rushing and loosening. Looking to the north, you can see the strange peaks and cliffs, and the cliffs are destroyed to the east. The gate of the cave is closed with a stone fan, and the ground is filled with clouds and thunder. Climbing high to look at Pengying, imagining Jinyintai. With a long roar at the gate of heaven, a cool breeze comes from thousands of miles. Four or five jade girls floated down to Jiugai. With a smile, I lead Su's hand, and I leave my Liuxia cup. Jishou worships him again, ashamed of being a fairy. In the open and small universe, how carefree is it to abandon the world."
浪漫,李白,游泰山六首 其二,唐,清晓骑白鹿，直上天门山。山际逢羽人，方瞳好容颜。扪萝欲就语，却掩青云关。遗我鸟迹书，飘然落岩间。其字乃上古，读之了不闲。感此三叹息，从师方未还。,Romantic,Li Bai,The second of six poems on Mount Tai,"Qingxiao rode a white deer straight up Tianmen Mountain. There is a feathered man in the mountains, and Fang Tong has a good face. Menluo wants to speak, but hides Qingyun Pass. I left my book on the bird's trace, and fell into the rocks. Its characters are ancient, and it is not idle to read them. Feeling these three sighs, I have not returned from my teacher."
浪漫,李白,游泰山六首 其三,唐,平明登日观，举手开云关。精神四飞扬，如出天地间。黄河从西来，窈窕入远山。凭崖揽八极，目尽长空闲。偶然值青童，绿发双云鬟。笑我晚学仙，蹉跎凋朱颜。踌躇忽不见，浩荡难追攀。,Romantic,Li Bai,The Three of Six Poems of Traveling to Mount Tai,"Climb to the sun in Pingming, raise your hand to open the cloud gate. The spirit is flying in all directions, like going out of heaven and earth. The Yellow River comes from the west and flows into the distant mountains. Relying on the cliff to grasp the eight poles, the eyes are free for as long as possible. Occasionally, he is a young boy with green hair and double clouds. Laughing at me learning to be a fairy late, I wasted my beautiful face. Hesitating and suddenly disappearing, the mighty is hard to catch up."
浪漫,李白,游泰山六首 其四,唐,清斋三千日，裂素写道经。吟诵有所得，众神卫我形。云行信长风，飒若羽翼生。攀崖上日观，伏槛窥东溟。海色动远山，天鸡已先鸣。银台出倒景，白浪翻长鲸。安得不死药，高飞向蓬瀛。,Romantic,Li Bai,Four out of six poems on Mount Tai,"During the three thousand days of Qingzhai, Li Su wrote the scriptures. There is income from reciting, and the gods guard me. Clouds travel and believe in the wind, rustling like wings. Climb the cliff to watch the sun, and look down on the threshold to see Dongming. The color of the sea moves the distant mountains, and the rooster crows first. The Yintai looks down, and the white waves turn over the long whale. Take the elixir and fly high to Pengying."
浪漫,李白,游泰山六首 其五,唐,日观东北倾，两崖夹双石。海水落眼前，天光遥空碧。千峰争攒聚，万壑绝凌历。缅彼鹤上仙，去无云中迹。长松入云汉，远望不盈尺。山花异人间，五月雪中白。终当遇安期，于此鍊玉液。,Romantic,Li Bai,Tour Taishan Six Poems Out of Five,"Riguan leans northeast, with two cliffs and two stones. The sea water falls in front of my eyes, and the sky is far away and blue. Thousands of peaks compete to gather, and thousands of ravines are beyond the calendar. Myanbi Crane went to the Immortal, and went to the cloudless middle. The long pine enters Yunhan, and the distance is not full. The mountain flowers are different from the world, and the snow is white in May. Finally, when you meet the safe period, here is the chain of jade liquid."

Holding the green Qiqin alone, walking among the green mountains at night. The mountain is bright and the moon is dew white, and the night is quiet and the wind is resting. Immortals travel to Bifeng, singing and singing everywhere. Silence entertains Qinghui, Yuzhen connects Cuiwei. Imagine the dance of the phoenix and the dance of the dragon and the tiger. I went to the sky to pick paw melons, but I was in a trance without remembering to return. Raise your hand to find out the light, and climb the weaving machine by mistake. Tomorrow morning sitting phase lost, but see five clouds flying."
浪漫,李白,游敬亭寄崔侍御,唐,我家敬亭下，辄继谢公作。相去数百年，风期宛如昨。登高素秋月，下望青山郭。俯视鸳鸯群，饮啄自鸣跃。夫子虽蹭蹬，瑶台雪中鹤。独立窥浮云，其心在寥廓。时来顾我笑，一饭葵与藿。世路如秋风，相逢尽萧索。腰间玉具剑，意许无遗诺。壮士不可轻，相期在云阁。,Romantic,Li Bai,You Jingting sends Cui Shiyu,"Under the Jingting Pavilion of my house, it was written by Mr. Xie. Hundreds of years have passed, and the wind season is like yesterday. Climbing up to Su Qiuyue, looking down at Qingshan Guo. Looking down at the group of mandarin ducks, drinking and pecking and singing. Although the master rubs his feet, the Yaotai is a crane in the snow. Peeping at the clouds independently, his heart is in the sky. From time to time, I come to look after me and laugh, and I have a meal of sunflower and husk. The road of the world is like the autumn wind, and every encounter is bleak. The jade sword on the waist promises nothing. A strong man should not be underestimated, and his phase is in Yunge."
浪漫,李白,游谢氏山亭,唐,沦老卧江海，再欢天地清。病闲久寂寞，岁物徒芬荣。借君西池游，聊以散我情。扫雪松下去，扪萝石道行。谢公池塘上，春草飒已生。花枝拂人来，山鸟向我鸣。田家有美酒，落日与之倾。醉罢弄归月，遥欣稚子迎。,Romantic,Li Bai,You Xie's Pavilion,"Falling old and lying in the river and sea, rejoicing in the world and clearing up. Sick and lonely for a long time, the old things are only fragrant. Borrow the king to swim in the west pool, chat to break up my love. Sweep the snow and go down the pine, walk on the rocky road. On Xiegong Pond, spring grass has grown. The flowers and branches come to me, and the mountain birds sing to me. There is good wine in Tianjia, and the setting sun falls with it. If you get drunk, you will return to the moon, and you will be greeted by the childish children."

The sky is clear and the dew is falling, and I feel the autumn wind returning. The wanderer asked his master, looking up at the eyebrows. Looking at Feihong, it is unattainable. Long appealed to each other, why come to Wuguan. It is heard that there is a virgin girl who shakes up the poor in Lishui Bay. The clear light is in the eyes, and the day is like a face. There are five or six piers in the high tomb, where tigers live in Wuwu. The ruins of Yijiuquan have been famous through the ages. Zixu used to beg for food, and this woman poured out a pot of pulp. Carrying out the old anger, entering Chu and whipping the king. In the cold world, it is famous as Huai Shuang. A strong man may not have reached it, ten steps and nine Taixing. Flick your clothes with you, and fly together for thousands of miles."

The spring breeze is here for that, and the butterflies are suddenly full of fragrant grass. The eyebrows are frosty and snowy, and the peach blossoms are beautiful, and the bone green marrow is green and beautiful. It is said that Qin Shi avoided the world, persuaded him to drink and have fun without knowing his old age. Each guards the ambition of the rabbit and the deer, and is ashamed to fight with the dragon and the tiger. The king of Han was shocked again when he raised the crown prince. Gu said Mrs. Qi, and the old man was full of wings. Returning to the foot of Nanshan Mountain, it is like clouds and ruthless. Raising the cup and drinking the nest, how can I wash my ears alone? Haoge looks at Songyue, and his spirit is still in the same direction."

The cinnabar turns into gold, and rides a dragon to Taiqing's house. Yunchou Haisi makes people sigh, and the beauty of the palace is like a flower.

The ancients preached and kept it, and the harem was full of beauty. Riding on a luan and flying smoke will not return, riding a dragon to climb the sky and build the sky. Create Tianguan, hear the language of heaven, and the Changyun River carries the jade girl. Zai Yunv passed the Zihuang, who gave the medicine pounded by the white rabbit, and it will wither away the day after tomorrow. Looking down at Yaochi to see the Queen Mother, her crescent eyebrows are as rustling as autumn frost."
浪漫,李白,琴曲歌辞 双燕离,唐,双燕复双燕，双飞令人羡。玉楼珠阁不独栖，金窗绣户长相见。柏梁失火去，因入吴王宫。吴宫又焚荡，雏尽巢亦空。憔悴一身在，孀雌忆故雄。双飞难再得，伤我寸心中。,Romantic,Li Bai,Song and Lyrics Shuang Yan Li,"Double swallows double swallows, double flying is enviable. The jade tower and pearl pavilion do not live alone, and the golden window embroidered households meet each other. Bo Liang went out in a fire, because he entered the Wu Palace. The palace of Wu burned again, and the nest was empty even after the chicks were exhausted. Haggard all over, the widow recalls the old man. The double flight is hard to come by again, it hurts my heart."

The two dragons do not jump together, and the five latitudes are the same as the sky. There is no heroic plan for Chu's destruction, but Hanxing has success. Press the sword to clear the eight poles, and return to the gale of singing. In the past, when I came to Guangwu, the company fought against each other. Take a share of my pie, the Taihuang is Ru Weng. There are historical sites in the war, and the barriers are decadent. Tigers howl in caves and ravines, hungry eagles sing in the autumn sky. Xiangyun arrayed in formation, murderous He Changhong. To bring order out of chaos belongs to the noble sage, and the vulgar Confucianism is safe to pass. Indulging in calling Shuzi, blatantly saying that he is not righteous. Touching the Yellow River Qu, chi chi Ruan Sizong."

How vast is the sand and dust, and the dragon and the tiger fight at night. Huma winds Chinese grass, Tianjiao frowns in the Central Plains. Philosopher felt bad luck, Yunpeng suddenly flew over. The group practice is based on the state of Chu, and the flags are connected to Haimen. There are millions of people in the Western Qin Dynasty, and the armor is like a cloud. Throwing a whip can fill the river, but a whip is not enough. The luck of the emperor has returned to the right, and the ugly captive has no soul. Talking and laughing stop the flow, and the common people hope to survive. When visiting historical sites in Yecheng, there is still Xie Andun. With a view of Zhou's land insurance, the high standard will never be noisy. Imagining the posture of Dongshan, remembering Youjunyan.

It's so strange to try to log in every week. Qingming relies on the sky to open, and the color is drawn in doubt. Appreciating the lingering purple clouds, I got a good trick. Sing Qiong Xiao in the clouds, play Baoser on the stone. There is still a little life in my life, and the laughter is over.

The bones of Liuao have been frosted, and the three mountains are still there. The hibiscus is half broken, and the sun shines brightly. Yintai Jinque is like a dream, Qinhuang Han Wukong treats each other. Jingwei costs wood and stone, and turtles have nothing to rely on. Don't you see that the mausoleum of Lishan Mountain is completely destroyed, and the son of the shepherd comes to climb it. The thieves rob the precious jade, how can the elves do it. The militarism is like this today, and the flying dragon in Dinghu can take advantage of it."

Tiankai emperor's residence, the sea shines on the palace. The peaks are like racing for a deer, rushing to and from each other. The river comes nine ways, but the clouds are far away. When the time moves to the Universiade, the dragon and the tiger rest. I come to belong to Tianqing, and I will visit Qiongchuyue. My sect stands up to Uncle Zen, especially showing the bones of the luan and phoenix. All the stars are in the sky, and the bright one has the moon alone. Meditate in accordance with the physiology, the vegetation is not cut. Smokestacks lead to roses, old wild ferns on stone walls. Wu Feng Xie An clogs, white feet proudly wearing socks.

The poems stay in Yanping, and the common people will never die for thousands of years."

You have been in the boating service, which makes my heart and soul miserable. There is no green grass in the land of Qin, and the clouds in the south are noisy and drumming. The king reduces the jade meal, wakes up early and thinks of crowing chickens. Cao Yin rescued Guan Fu, and the tired people were free from mud. The prime minister makes rain, and the farmer gets the plow. Those who are quiet lie in the grass, and the group is full of golden boudoir. There are no strong men with empty hands, and poverty makes people low. Send you off to climb Huangshan Mountain, shouting and leaning on the ladder. A small boat is like a duck and a wild goose, and a big boat is like a whale salamander. Open the sails to disperse the long wind, Shujuan and the clouds.

Five or six immortals often hear about this tour. The stream is high and the water is high, and the stone towers the Magu altar. The white dragon descends to Lingyang, and the yellow crane calls Zi'an. As a feather, ride the sun and the moon, and fly in the clouds. Looking down at the universe, there are waves everywhere. How difficult it is to get rid of the eyes and do things. A hundred years old is halfway through, and the early stage is long. Strong food doesn't taste good, and I get up early in the morning and sigh. I would like to go with Ziming and burn the golden elixir with chain fire."
浪漫,李白,登敬亭北二小山余时送客逢崔侍御并登此地,唐,送客谢亭北，逢君纵酒还。屈盘戏白马，大笑上青山。回鞭指长安，西日落秦关。帝乡三千里，杳在碧云间。,Romantic,Li Bai,"Climb Jingting Pavilion Beier Xiaoshan.

浪漫,李白,禅房怀友人岑伦,唐,婵娟罗浮月，摇艳桂水云。美人竟独往，而我安得群。一朝语笑隔，万里欢情分。沈吟綵霞没，梦寐群芳歇。归鸿渡三湘，游子在百粤。边尘染衣剑，白日彫华发。春风变楚关，秋声落吴山。草木结悲绪，风沙凄苦颜。朅来已永久，颓思如循环。飘飘限江裔，想像空留滞。离忧每醉心，别泪徒盈袂。坐愁青天末，出望黄云蔽。目极何悠悠，梅花南岭头。空长灭征鸟，水阔无还舟。宝剑终难托，金囊非易求。归来傥有问，桂树山之幽。,Romantic,Li Bai,"Cen Lun, a friend in the meditation room","The moon is beautiful and the floating moon is shaking the beautiful osmanthus and water clouds. The beauty goes alone, but I am in a group. Once the words and laughter are separated, thousands of miles of joy will be shared. Thinking about the colorful clouds, the dreaming group is resting. Returning to Hongdu Sanxiang, wandering in Baiyue. Bian Chen dyes clothes and swords, and carves Huafa in the daytime. The spring breeze changes Chuguan, and the autumn sound falls to Wushan. The vegetation is sad, and the wind and sand are sad. The past is eternal, and decadent thoughts are like a cycle. Floating and limited to the descendants of the Jiang, imaginary stays in the air. Every time Liyou is intoxicated, don't cry but fill your sleeves. Sitting sad at the end of the blue sky, looking out at the yellow clouds. He Youyou, the head of plum blossoms in Nanling. The sky is long and the birds are exterminated, and the water is wide and there is no boat to return. A sword is hard to trust, but a golden bag is hard to find. When I come back, I have a question, the quietness of Guishu Mountain."

Cut off Aoyi Wahuang, chain stones mend Tianwei. Go back to the sun and the moon once, and enter Fenghuangchi three times. How long will it take to grow melons when you lose your power and be next to Qingmen? The guests of the Jewish congregation, three thousand light paths. Huang Enxue is resentful, and pines and cypresses are full of glory. I'm not from the east bed, so my sister is ashamed. Wandering was not born, and the name moved the capital. It was suitable to be solved by Yunluo, and Yelang was sad when he was relegated. My humble wife, Mo Xiejian, and these two dragons.

Genke sprinkles fragrance, collects and takes to moisten muscles and bones. Clusters of old volumes of green leaves, branches connected one after another. Exposed into a cactus, like patting the shoulders of Hong Ya. The whole world has never seen it, and its name will be passed on. Zongying is the uncle of Zen, and there are good articles in the present. There is no salt in the clear mirror candle, and Gu Xiziyan is ashamed. Sitting in the court has more fun, singing long songs to the heavens."

But in the sky mirror, it is clearly similar to the painting. I love this search from the dark, and I will swim forever in my arms. One is a Cangbo guest, ten sees red stalks and autumn. Watching the waves is magnificent and dangerous, and looking at the sea is worrying. The road is forced to shine in the west, and the sadness flows eastward at the end of the year.

There is no Xuanshang contract, and it is known as haze. Taste hate and force the world network, but the inscription has not been stretched. Although the pines and cypresses are cold and bitter, they are ashamed to chase peaches and plums. In the long city, the jade face is day-to-day. What you lose is heavy mountains, what you gain is light dust. Essence gradually becomes depraved and filthy, and aging depends on the cause. I have a bag of tricks, which can hold the body of a king. When eating golden medicine, go to Ziyang Bin. All things are difficult to stand together, and a hundred years is still worshiping the morning. Don't go southeast, it's so sad. The previous aspirations are not easy, and the long-distance period is followed. It's gone back, Bai Yunfei Tianjin."

浪漫,李白,鲁郡尧祠送窦明府薄华还西京,唐,朝策犁眉騧，举鞭力不堪。强扶愁疾向何处，角巾微服尧祠南。长杨扫地不见日，石门喷作金沙潭。笑誇故人指绝境，山光水色青于蓝。庙中往往来击鼓，尧本无心尔何苦。门前长跪双石人，有女如花日歌舞。银鞍绣毂往复回，簸林蹶石鸣风雷。远烟空翠时明灭，白鸥历乱长飞雪。红泥亭子赤阑干，碧流环转青锦湍。深沈百丈洞海底，那知不有蛟龙蟠。君不见绿珠潭水流东海，绿珠红粉沈光彩。绿珠楼下花满园，今日曾无一枝在。昨夜秋声阊阖来，洞庭木落骚人哀。遂将三五少年辈，登高远望形神开。生前一笑轻九鼎，魏武何悲铜雀台。我歌白云倚窗牖，尔闻其声但挥手。长风吹月度海来，遥劝仙人一杯酒。酒中乐酣宵向分，举觞酹尧尧可闻。何不令皋繇拥彗横八极，直上青天挥浮云。高阳小饮真琐琐，山公酩酊何如我。竹林七子去道赊，兰亭雄笔安足誇。尧祠笑杀五湖水，至今憔悴空荷花。尔向西秦我东越，暂向瀛洲访金阙。蓝田太白若可期，为余扫洒石上月。,Romantic,Li Bai,Yao Temple in Lu County sends Dou Mingfu Bohua back to Xijing,"Chao Ce plowed his eyebrows, and his whip was unbearable. Where does the strong support the sorrow and the disease go, and the horn scarf micro-serves the south of the Yao Temple. Changyang sweeps the ground to see the sun, and Shimen sprays into a golden sand pool. Laughing and boasting that the old man pointed out the desperate situation, the mountains and rivers are greener than blue. The temple often comes and beats drums, Yao has no intention of doing so, so why bother. There are two stone figures kneeling in front of the door, and there are women singing and dancing like flowers. The silver saddle and embroidered hub go back and forth, and the wind and thunder blow from the forest and rocks. When the smoke is far away and the sky is emerald, the lights are on and off, and the white gulls experience chaos and snow. The red mud pavilion is red and dry, and the blue stream turns around the green brocade. Deep in the bottom of the Baizhang Cave, do you know if there are dragons and pans? Don't you see the water in the Green Pearl Lake flows into the East China Sea, and the green pearls and red powder sink into glory. The garden downstairs of Luzhu is full of flowers, and today there was no branch. Last night, the sound of autumn came, and the trees in Dongting fell and people mourned. So the three or five young people climbed up and looked at their bodies and spirits from afar. When he was alive, he smiled and lightened the nine tripods, and Wei Wuhe mourned the Tongque Terrace. I sing Baiyun leaning against the window, and you hear his voice but wave your hands. The long wind blows the moon to the sea, and Yao persuades the immortal to drink a glass of wine. The music is in the wine and the night is divided, and the wine can be heard when the wine is raised. Why don't you let Gao Yao hold the comet across the eight poles, and go straight up to the blue sky to wave the floating clouds. Small drinks in Gaoyang are really trivial, and monkeys are as drunk as me. The seven sons of the bamboo forest went to Taoist credit, and Lan Tingxiong's pen was full of praise. The Yao Temple laughed and killed the water of the five lakes, and the lotus flowers are now haggard. I went west to Qin and I went east to Yue, and temporarily went to Yingzhou to visit Jinque. If Lantian Taibai can be expected, he will sweep and sprinkle stones for the rest of the month."
浪漫,李白,塞上曲,唐,大汉无中策，匈奴犯渭桥。五原秋草绿，胡马一何骄。命将征西极，横行阴山侧。燕支落汉家，妇女无华色。转战渡黄河，休兵乐事多。萧条清万里，瀚海寂无波。,Romantic,Li Bai,plug the song,"The Han had no choice, and the Xiongnu invaded Weiqiao.

It's a sad festival, recalling the border towns from afar. The firefly flies and the autumn window is full, and the moon is frosty and the boudoir is late. Destroy the sycamore leaves, Xiao Sa Sha Tang branches. There is no time to see alone, and tears are empty to know."

In the west of Zhejiang Province in Zuojun, the sickness must drive away. There are moss on the steps, and the birds are noisy. When riding on flat shoulders, people are afraid of knowing when they go in and out. The north house chats and rests, and the joy is long. Ashamed to say that Liang Yuan land, Xuan He Yao banners. There are eight or nine brothers, Wu and Qin are separated. Taixian is a sign of opportunity, so he only cares about safety and danger.

It turns northwest in the morning and blows southeast in the evening. It is difficult to hang up the seats, and the good times will make you lovesick. The sea moon breaks the round shadow, and the wild rice grows a green pond. Yesterday the plum blossoms in Beihu were full of blossoms.

Although there are no three seats, don't borrow the name of the four heroes. Passionate wind and cloud energy, eventually cooperate with dragon and tiger spirit. When the weak crown Yanzhao comes, the virtuous Yan is more welcome. Lu Lianshan talked and laughed, and Ji Buzhe was a minister. Knowing the number of etiquette in the distance, I am often afraid of not merging. If you want to end your night dream, your heart has been dark for a long time. Gu is ashamed of the Qingyun utensils, but the jade bottles are poured out. In the five hundred years of Shanyang, the green bamboo suddenly flourished again. Sing loudly to vibrate the trees, laugh loudly and thunderously. When pen and ink are sprinkled in seal script, the collapse of the cloud is shocking. Speech and Binghuan, five-color Luo Huaxing. Beautiful sentences are all over the country, and high talents are in heaven. When the governor is in trouble, the ancient city is empty with floating clouds. Residents like shaving grass, sweeping the ground without slender stems. Hui Zeji flew away, and the farmers returned to farming. Guanghan water is thousands of miles long, and the sound of jade qin flows. Yasong spreads to Wu and Yue, but it is still as flat as Taiji. Don't leave Jinling, boy. When you come, you will come to Baixia Pavilion. The phoenixes pity the birds, and they mourn each other. Each plucks the hair of five colors, meaning more than Mount Tai. It costs a lot to donate micro-gifts, and buckets of water water long whales. Playing swords and songs is bitterly cold, and the wind blows in front of the couplet. The moon is titled Tianmen dawn, and the frost falls on Niu Zhuqing. A long sigh is the way back, Linchuan empty screen camp."
浪漫,李白,蜀道难,唐,噫吁戏，危乎高哉，蜀道之难难于上青天！蚕丛及鱼凫，开国何茫然。尔来四万八千岁，不与秦塞通人烟。西当太白有鸟道，可以横绝峨眉巅。地崩山摧壮士死，然后天梯石栈相钩连。上有六龙回日之高标，下有冲波逆折之回川。黄鹤之飞尚不得过，猿猱欲度愁攀援。青泥何盘盘，百步九折萦岩峦。扪参历井仰胁息，以手抚膺坐长叹。问君西游何时还？畏途巉岩不可攀。但见悲鸟号古木，雄飞雌从绕林间。又闻子规啼夜月，愁空山，蜀道之难难于上青天，使人听此凋朱颜。连峰去天不盈尺，枯松倒挂倚绝壁。飞湍瀑流争喧豗，砯厓转石万壑雷。其险也如此，嗟尔远道之人胡为乎来哉！剑阁峥嵘而崔嵬，一夫当关，万夫莫开。所守或匪亲，化为狼与豺。朝避猛虎，夕避长蛇。磨牙吮血，杀人如麻。锦城虽云乐，不如早还家。蜀道之难难于上青天，侧身西望长咨嗟。,Romantic,Li Bai,Shu road is difficult,"Alas, the danger is high, the road to Shu is more difficult than going to the blue sky! Cancong and yufu, how at a loss was the founding of the country. You are 48,000 years old, and you will not live with Qin Saitong. Xidang Taibai has a bird path, which can cross the Emei peak.

On the top is the high mark of the six dragons returning to the sun, and on the bottom there is the rushing and turning back to Sichuan. the yellow crane can't fly too fast, and the ape wants to overcome his sorrow and climb for help. What a pan of green mud, a hundred steps and ten folds of lingering rocks. I went to the Lijing well and raised my breath, touched my chest with my hands and sat down with a long sigh. When will I return Journey to the West? If you are afraid of the road, you will not be able to climb the rock. But I saw the ancient wood of the Mourning Bird, male and female flying around the forest. I also heard Zigui singing the moon at night, worrying about the empty mountains, and the difficulty of the road to Shu is harder than going up to the blue sky, which makes people listen to this withered beauty. Even the peaks go to the sky without a foot, and the withered pine hangs upside down and leans against the cliff. The turbulent waterfall competes for noise, and the cliffs turn into rocks and thunder. The same is true of the danger. People who are far away from you are doing nothing! Jiange is towering and towering, while Cui Wei is guarded by one man, and ten thousand men cannot open it. The guardian or bandit relatives turned into wolves and jackals. Avoid tigers in the morning and long snakes in the evening. Grinding teeth and sucking blood, killing people like hemp. Although Jincheng is happy, it is better to return home early. The difficulty of the road to Shu is harder than going up to the blue sky, looking sideways to the west and sighing."

The noble officials in Shandong have a handsome spirit, and they bring this thing in their hands to present it to people far away. The two look at each other, fighting wine and Pisces have plain expressions. The double gills, the fins and the mane are open, and the silver plate is about to fly away.

Luanhe, I will be the first, but the dragon's nature cannot be tamed. Pu San is not old-fashioned, and all the falsehoods of the time are distorted. Don't step on the slopes of the barren stream, just come to Haoranjin. How can Xue take away from Chu, and Taoyuan can avoid Qin. The world is forced and parting, and the heart is hidden in the period. Rewards are not admonitions, and you will always say that you are a gentry."

With a sad face and a new love, the final banquet tells the past. Yan Gong is old in the Han court, gloomy and talented. The price is heavy on the copper dragon building, and the sound is high on the side of the door. Ning expects to meet here, and Huaguan will accompany you for a rest. The snow covered the distant peaks, and the cold city locks the spring scenery. The master looks forward to the common people, but I am Qingyunyi.

The distant mountains are full of emerald green islands, and the remnant clouds are flying red and reflecting the grass in the river. Condensing the flowers and dew, a few years of success have been achieved. The old man gave me a gift, and I will not disobey it, and make the mountains and rivers contain Qinghui. I am surprised to thank Kangle, and poetry flourishes in my clothes. The forests and ravines in front of the lapel hold back the dark colors, and the clouds on the sleeves hold the sunset.

The Lord of Consecration said in the past that it was true, but now he is confused. I live in the north of the lacquer garden, and I have not been to the west of Xianyang for a long time. The wind falls and the sun goes, and the seasons change and the birds cry. Tao Lihan is not open, how come the secluded pass. Fengjun hair calyx, if with Qingyun Qi. And the mulberry leaves are green, and the spring silkworms rise from the boudoir. At sunrise the cuckoo crows, and Tian's family holds a plow. Gu Yu lacks a foot of land, and whoever works in the east will help him. Fu said that it will rain, and Gongshu will build a ladder. The Qiang army has not stopped, and the gentleman is sad. There is a long-term strategy to serve the country, and success is shameful. There is no reason to call on the Ming Lord, and the stick policy is still fluffy.

Jilang Wanguxian thinks it is a children's play. Establishing property is like widening expenses, Kuang Jun has a long-term plan. But the bitter mountain is cold in the north, who knows the south house. The old wine is chasing the wind, and the frost is white on both sides. The master of Shu thinks of Kong Ming, and the family of Jin looks at Anshi. At that time, people lined up five tripods, talking and laughing all the time. The tiger is covered by the tiger dust, and the fisherman's song swims on the seashore. Disgraceful Qiu shames his wife and sister-in-law, and entrusts the long sword to his relatives.

All the fallen leaves are scattered, each scattered in the Dongting stream. If you don't meet each other in middle age, you will travel around Wuyue. Where do I miss you, the green moon on the rooftop. The wind and the moon in Kuaiji are good, but they go back around the Shanxi River. Clouds, mountains and seas come out, and figures come out of the mirror. Once in the north of Zhejiang, drunk in Chutai for ten years. Jingmen fell to the Song Dynasty, and Liang Yuan fell to Zou Mei. I exaggerate with a wry smile, and my bosom friend is safe. The thief cuts the gap like the wind sweeps the autumn leaves.

In the Ming Dynasty, I flick my clothes away, and I will always be with the seagulls."

How can the sky be as high as a hundred feet? Peaches and plums are sold in the sun, and passers-by are fascinated. The spring is gone, and the green leaves are turned into yellow mud.

The high name moves the capital, and everyone in the world is a native. The Sri Lankan people can't afford it, and the clouds lie down. If there is no aid to replace the heart, it is no good to be alone. But those who are from the royal family will die every time they die. Talking about the sky is mighty, talking about swords. Xie Gong is not in vain, he rose up for the sake of the common people. He Jiji, the secretary, is nothing but a hero. And return to Bishan, An Neng loves Jinque. In the old house for firewood and fishing, the basil has disappeared. But Gu Nu Jifeng, Hu Yan sees Yunyue."

As soon as it is called, it is Zhu Fu, and fifty silver medals are worn. Drinking ice is a matter of soldiers, and clothing is Jinhua Water Town. Tens of thousands of copper officials filed a lawsuit against Qing Yutang. Talk about precious pearls and jade, and put pen to paper to return to Fengshuang. And I thank the Lord Ming, mourning Yelang. There are many wine debts at home, and the diners are happy. There are four high-level talks, and a thousand cups of wine are poured out in a day.

Pingming is empty and screaming, thinking about solving the world. The heart goes with the long wind, blowing away thousands of miles of clouds. I am ashamed to be a Jinan student, and I recite ninety ancient prose. Otherwise, with a flick of the sword, the desert will receive Qixun. Between old age and death, why Yang Qingfen. The master is now a wind instrument, and his talents are the best in the three armies. How can it frustrate the group if it ends up with the same source."

Self-care and little planning, fame and fame are safe. Wumu thinks about throwing a throw, like a rope tied to a poor ape. The steeds in the stable are empty, and the hall is intoxicating and noisy. The gold has long been exhausted, and I will pay my debts in return. Wen Junlong's journey to the west shocked me. Flying with you, the clouds and the sky are flying. It's hard to say whether the river flows or rolls. Poor families are ashamed of hospitality, and their speech is clumsy and complicated. Nothing wrong with San Chaokong, but he is ashamed of his innocence. I laugh at myself as a non-husband, and I have a lot of troubles. Accumulate eternal anger, who can forgive me. The sky and the earth are floating clouds, and this body is nothing. Suddenly there is no clue, but Taixu can be included. What is the way to go, and you will worry about Lin Qikong. The liver and gallbladder are not Chuyue, and the mountains and rivers are also in quilt. If Yunlong follows each other, the Ming Lord will meet and accept. Successful solution visits, streams of peach blossoms flow."

Return to Bushanyin, and rise to the height of the sky. It's too late for you to go to Anke, and the Yaocao may decline. My heart is also pregnant, and I have repeatedly dreamed of pine last month.

I would like to talk about playing Shenghe, and I will depend on each other at the end of the year."

The phoenix tree falls into the golden well, and a leaf flies to the silver bed. When I wake up, I hold the mirror, and the temples are frosted. A good picture is covered with vines, and the ancient appearance becomes a withered mulberry. If you want to do things with your heart, people are suspicious of night light. Because of the Dongting leaves, the falling Xiaoxiang. Let my younger brother be an economic scholar, how can I be relegated to live here? Qianqiu hides a foot of water, and writes about the rise and fall. The guest met Prince Qiao, and the word of mouth never died.

Song Yu is the king of Xiang, who can write a poem for Gao Tang. I often hear the green water song, but suddenly I meet again. Sweep the blue sky and open, suddenly covered with clouds and mists. Vigorous purple luan bird nests in a tree in Kunshan. The startling wind blows northwest, and flies down to the Southern Sea. Early conceived of economic policy, especially by the care of Long Yan.

I pay a visit to Taishan Lord in the evening, and see that the sun is not cloudy. In the middle of the night, lying on the mountain and the moon, flinging away from the crowd with a flick of clothes. Granting Yu Jin the way of immortality, I have never heard of it before Kuang Kalpa. The dark machine sends out the light of the sky, and the atmosphere is alone. The virtual boat is not tied to things, and you can watch the rivers and lakes. Jiang Yu met the same voice, and Daoya was a monk. Said to move Haiyue, travel Fanghua Gongqing. Holding the jade stag tail in hand, it is like climbing a white pavilion. Micro-words comment on hundreds of rivers, and the letter is audible. There is a group of wind and drums, and all sounds sing their own. Open and close the eight windows, and hold the host to switch on the electric thunder. Self-proclaimed Li Tiantai, fighting against the wall to follow the green screen. Ling Jing goes to the stone bridge, and enters Qingming in a trance.

If there is no moon between the clouds, who can compare to the glory. Once the beauty is like this, most of the women ridicule it. Jun En moved past love, fell out of favor and returned with the autumn wind. Don't peek at your neighbors when you are sad, and cry for the yellow machine. The sky is cold and the hands are cold, and the night is long and the candle is faint. Ten days are not enough for a horse, and the temples are unkempt. Still a poor man, Rong Hua is rare in the world. Send your teeth to Jun, don't care about me."

Liu Kun and Zu Ti danced and crowed in the morning. Although he has a heart to help others, he ends up taking pleasure in harming others. I am different from that, diving into the Anhui waterfront. Buzhu Si Kongyuan, adjacent to Tianzhu in the north. The snow is shining for thousands of miles, and the clouds are blooming in the spring of Jiujiang. As soon as the Thai level is flat, then take care of yourself. Dumping the golden tripod of family affairs, the young looks can be renewed. If you want to get this way, you will always keep the halal. Get the scenery and run to the sun, climb the stars and play Hejin. As soon as Wang Qiao goes, Yu Tianbin is always there."

The children in Xiangyang clapped their hands together, blocking the street and fighting to sing the cupronickel. People around asked what was the matter with laughter, and laughed to kill monkeys drunk like mud. Cormorant dippers, parrot cups, 36,000 days in a hundred years, three hundred cups must be poured a day. Looking at the green duck head of Han Shui from a distance, it looks like the first wine of grapes. If this river is turned into spring wine, it will build bad hills and terraces. Thousands of golden horses exchange for young concubines, sitting drunk on carved saddles and singing plum blossoms. A jug of wine is hung on the side of the car, and Feng Sheng and Long Guan are urging each other. The city of Xianyang laments the yellow dog, but it is like pouring a golden scorpion under the moon. Don't you see that in the Jin Dynasty, Yanggong was a piece of stone, and the turtle and dragon peeled off the raw berry moss. Tears cannot fall for it, nor can the heart mourn for it. Who can worry about his death, the golden duck and the silver duck are buried in ashes. You don't need to pay a penny to buy the breeze and the moon, but Yushan is not recommended by anyone. Shuzhou Piao, Lishi Dang, Li Bai and you die together. King Xiang Yunyu is here today, and the river flows eastward with the sound of ape night."

Ai Hong is sour and hoarse at night, his voice is urgent, and his clouds are gloomy and cold. I recall that I went home yesterday as a guest, and the lotus flowers were just red and the willows were green. Drink three hundred cups at mid-night, and return two thousand stones in the Ming Dynasty. Ning Zhiliu's residence becomes glorious, Hu Shuang and Xiao Sa go around guest clothes. Who can warm the cold gray and lonely, and where can I return to when the fallen leaves are fluttering. My brother is happy and poor, and the house is full of beauty like jade. Zhao Nv's long song enters the colorful clouds, and Yan Ji dances drunkenly with red candles. Fox fur and animal charcoal drink the flowing clouds, and the strong man sings sadly and would rather see the sigh. The former was prosperous and the latter was overturned, why cherish the remaining light and Dihua."

Huang Nu held her teeth full and raised her hair, and the concubine of Han went to Li Tianting. In life, morality cannot protect itself, and saints use it to push the way of heaven. Don't you see Cai Ze's inlaid withered and strange shape, and he blatantly took the Prime Minister of Qin directly. I don't see that Tian Qianqiu's talent and wisdom are beyond the reach of others, and once he was rich and honored, he was like a god. The second marquis works in the square book, and the old man Qilin is in distress. Ye Guang holds grudges and laments, and the sun and the moon are passing away."

The world is called Haogui, and you will meet every time you travel here. Luoyang Su Jizi, the sword and halberd Sen Cifeng. Although the six seals are not worn, the car is like a flying dragon. There are hundreds of yi of gold, and several pairs of white jade. Don't care about the empty space, singing songs and returning Qiong. That's the case with desperation, who doesn't follow. Far away from two rivers, there are thousands of clouds and mountains. When to drink more wine, you have to talk about your heart."
浪漫,李白,灞陵行送别,唐,送君灞陵亭，灞水流浩浩。上有无花之古树，下有伤心之春草。我向秦人问路岐，云是王粲南登之古道。古道连绵走西京，紫阙落日浮云生。正当今夕断肠处，黄鹂愁绝不忍听。,Romantic,Li Bai,Farewell trip to Baling,"Send you off to the Baling Pavilion, where the Ba water flows vastly. There are old trees without flowers on the top, and sad spring grass on the bottom. I asked Lu Qi from the people of Qin, and it was said that it was the ancient road that Wang Can ascended to the south. The ancient roads continue to walk through Xijing, and the sunset of Zique is full of clouds. At the moment when the heart is broken, Huang Li can't bear to listen to it."

The kunwhale sprayed, and the waves thundered. Fish and dragons trap people and become such a disaster. The fire burns Kunshan, and the jade and stone burn together. Yang Xilin rain, sprinkle Baoyan simmer. The arrow flies away from the stone, and the spear returns to the sun. Zou Yan wept bitterly, and Yan Shuang came whistling. Sincerity does not feel, it is like Xiatai. The goshawk grabs, and the Danthorn Cui Wei. Hao Sheng withered, Wang Feng mourned. If the gentleness is not lost, Dongyue will not be decadent. Mu escaped from the disaster of Chu, and Zou escaped from the disaster of Wu. It was too late to see the opportunity, so the second gong came to the rescue. If you don't advance suddenly, where will Lin come from? The star leaves one door, and throws away the second child. Thousands of angry knots, worries from reminders. Jinse Yuhu, all for sorrow. Lifting the wine too much, weeping the blood to fill the cup. The stars of Taiwan are bright again, and the sky is restored. Qu Fashen'en, discarding flaws and drawing materials. Ye Chang is not a crime, but my father has no guess. The raspberry is lifted, and it should be as cold ashes."

The wild swallows nest in the official residence, and the stream and clouds enter the ancient hall. The sun is slanting and the lonely officials pass by, and the curtains are in disorder and the peaks are green. Five-color fairy captain, burns incense and reads Taoism scriptures."
浪漫,李白,赠崔秋浦三首,唐,吾爱崔秋浦，宛然陶令风。门前五杨柳，井上二梧桐。山鸟下厅事，檐花落酒中。怀君未忍去，惆怅意无穷。崔令学陶令，北窗常昼眠。抱琴时弄月，取意任无弦。见客但倾酒，为官不爱钱。东皋春事起，种黍早归田。河阳花作县，秋浦玉为人。地逐名贤好，风随惠化春。水从天汉落，山逼画屏新。应念金门客，投沙吊楚臣。,Romantic,Li Bai,Three Songs for Cui Qiupu,"I love Cui Qiupu just like Tao Lingfeng. There are five willows in front of the gate, and two sycamore trees on Inoue. The mountain bird went down to the hall, and the flowers on the eaves fell into the wine. Huai Jun couldn't bear to go, feeling endlessly melancholy. Cui Ling learns from Tao Ling, and sleeps day and night by the north window. Playing with the moon while holding the qin, take whatever you want without strings. Seeing guests but pouring wine, being an official does not love money. Donggao started the spring incident, and the millet planted returned to the field early. Heyang is a county of flowers, and Qiupuyu is a man. The land is famous and good, and the wind turns into spring with the benefits. The water falls from the sky, and the mountains force the painting screen to be new. You should read the golden gate guest and cast sand to mourn the ministers of Chu."
浪漫,李白,同族侄评事黯游昌禅师山池二首,唐,远公爱康乐，为我开禅关。萧然松石下，何异清凉山。花将色不染，水与心俱闲。一坐度小劫，观空天地间。客来花雨际，秋水落金池。片石寒青锦，疏杨挂绿丝。高僧拂玉柄，童子献霜梨。惜去爱佳景，烟萝欲暝时。,Romantic,Li Bai,Two Poems by the Nephew of the Same Clan,"Yuangong loves happiness and opened the Zen gate for me. Under Xiao Ran's pines and rocks, what a difference is Qingliang Mountain. The flowers will not be dyed in color, and the water and the heart will be free. Sitting through the small kalpa, watching the sky and the earth. When the guests come to spend the rain, the autumn water falls into the golden pool. Pieces of stone are cold and green brocade, sparse poplars hang green silk. The eminent monk brushes the jade handle, and the boy offers frost pears. Cherish to love the beautiful scenery, when the smoke is about to darken."
浪漫,李白,奔亡道中五首,唐,苏武天山上，田横海岛边。万重关塞断，何日是归年。亭伯去安在，李陵降未归。愁容变海色，短服改胡衣。谈笑三军却，交游七贵疏。仍留一只箭，未射鲁连书。,Romantic,Li Bai,Five Songs on the Road to Death,"On Suwu Tianshan Mountain, beside Tianheng Island. Thousands of barriers are broken, when is the year of return. Ting Bo went to Anzai, but Li Ling did not return. The sad face turns into the color of the sea, and the short clothes change into Hu Yi.

浪漫,李白,金陵三首,唐,晋家南渡日，此地旧长安。地即帝王宅，山为龙虎盘。金陵空壮观，天堑净波澜。醉客回桡去，吴歌且自欢。地拥金陵势，城回江水流。当时百万户，夹道起朱楼。亡国生春草，离宫没古丘。空馀后湖月，波上对江州。六代兴亡国，三杯为尔歌。苑方秦地少，山似洛阳多。古殿吴花草，深宫晋绮罗。并随人事灭，东逝与沧波。,Romantic,Li Bai,Jinling Three Poems,"The Jin family crossed the sun in the south, this place is old Chang'an. The land is the emperor's house, and the mountain is the dragon and tiger plate. Jinling is magnificent in the sky, and the sky is clean. The drunken guest goes back, and Wu Ge is happy with himself. The land embraces Jinling, and the city flows back to the river. At that time, there were millions of households, and Zhulou was built along the road. Spring grass grows when the country is subjugated, and there are no ancient hills in the palace. After the spare time, the lake moon, facing Jiangzhou on the waves. The six generations have risen and fallen, and the three cups are songs for you. There is less land in Yuanfang Qin, but more mountains than Luoyang. Wu Huacao in the ancient palace, Jin Qiluo in the deep palace. And with the death of personnel, the east died and Cangbo."
浪漫,李白,感遇四首,唐,吾爱王子晋，得道伊洛滨。金骨既不毁，玉颜长自春。可怜浮丘公，猗靡与情亲。举首白日间，分明谢时人。二仙去已远，梦想空殷勤。昔余闻姮娥，窃药驻云发。不自娇玉颜，方希鍊金骨。飞去身莫返，含笑坐明月。紫宫誇蛾眉，随手会凋歇。宋玉事楚王，立身本高洁。巫山赋綵云，郢路歌白雪。举国莫能和，巴人皆卷舌。一感登徒言，恩情遂中绝。,Romantic,Li Bai,Feeling four,"love Wang Zijin, who got the Tao of Yiluobin. The golden bones are not destroyed, and the jade face is always spring. Poor Lord Fuqiu, Yi Mi and his relatives. Raise your head in the daytime, clearly thank the people of the time. The two immortals are far away, and the dream is empty. In the past, I heard that Heng'e stole medicine and sent it in the cloud. Not self-delicate and jade-like, Fang Xi has a golden bone. Fly away and never return, sit on the bright moon with a smile on your face. Zigong's exaggerated crescent eyebrows will wither easily. Song Yu is the king of Chu, and he is noble and pure. Wushan Fu Caiyun, Ying Road song Baixue. The whole country can't make peace, and the people of Pakistan are all tongue-tied. As soon as I express my words in vain, the kindness is cut off."
浪漫,李白,自溧水道哭王炎三首,唐,白杨双行行，白马悲路傍。晨兴见晓月，更似发云阳。溧水通吴关，逝川去未央。故人万化尽，闭骨茅山冈。天上坠玉棺，泉中掩龙章。名飞日月上，义与风云翔。逸气竟莫展，英图俄夭伤。楚国一老人，来嗟龚胜亡。有言不可道，雪泣忆兰芳。王公希代宝，弃世一何早。吊死不及哀，殡宫已秋草。悲来欲脱剑，挂向何枝好。哭向茅山虽未摧，一生泪尽丹阳道。,Romantic,Li Bai,Three Poems of Crying Wang Yan from Lishui Road,"The white poplar walks in two lines, and the white horse is sad beside the road. Seeing Xiaoyue in the morning, it is more like sending out clouds and sun. Lishui passes through Wuguan, and passes away to Weiyang. The old man is exhausted, and the bones of Maoshan are closed. The jade coffin falls from the sky, and the dragon seal is hidden in the spring. The name flies above the sun and the moon, righteousness and wind and clouds soar. There is no way to show off the air, and Yingtu and Russia are injured prematurely. An old man from the state of Chu came to lament the death of Gong Sheng. There is nothing to say, snow weeps and recalls Lanfang. Wang Gong Xidaibao, how soon will he pass away. Hanging is not as good as mourning, the funeral palace is already autumn grass. Sadness comes and wants to take off the sword, hang it on He Zhihao. Crying to Maoshan Although it is not destroyed, I have cried all my life in Danyang Road."
浪漫,李白,宫中行乐词,唐,小小生金屋，盈盈在紫微。山花插宝髻，石竹绣罗衣。每出深宫里，常随步辇归。只愁歌舞散，化作綵云飞。柳色黄金嫩，梨花白雪香。玉楼巢翡翠，金殿锁鸳鸯。选妓随雕辇，徵歌出洞房。宫中谁第一，飞燕在昭阳。卢橘为秦树，蒲萄出汉宫。烟花宜落日，丝管醉春风。笛奏龙鸣水，箫吟凤下空。君王多乐事，何必向回中。玉树春归日，金宫乐事多。后庭朝未入，轻辇夜相过。笑出花间语，娇来烛下歌。莫教明月去，留著醉姮娥。绣户香风暖，纱窗曙色新。宫花争笑日，池草暗生春。绿树闻歌鸟，青楼见舞人。昭阳桃李月，罗绮自相亲。今日明光里，还须结伴游。春风开紫殿，天乐下珠楼。艳舞全知巧，娇歌半欲羞。更怜花月夜，宫女笑藏钩。寒雪梅中尽，春风柳上归。宫莺娇欲醉，檐燕语还飞。迟日明歌席，新花艳舞衣。晚来移綵仗，行乐泥光辉。水绿南薰殿，花红北阙楼。莺歌闻太液，凤吹绕瀛洲。素女鸣珠佩，天人弄綵毬。今朝风日好，宜入未央游。,Romantic,Li Bai,palace music,"small golden house is born, and Yingying is in Ziwei. Mountain flowers are placed in a bun, and carnations are embroidered on clothes. Every time I go out of the deep palace, I often return with my chariot. I only worry about singing and dancing, turning into colorful clouds. The willow color is golden and tender, and the pear blossoms are white and snowy. The emerald in the jade tower nest, the mandarin duck in the golden palace lock. Choose a prostitute with the carved chariot, sing songs and leave the bridal chamber. Whoever is number one in the palace, Feiyan is in Zhaoyang. Luju is a Qin tree, and grapes come out of the Han Palace. Fireworks are suitable for the setting sun, and the silk tubes are drunk with the spring breeze. The flute plays the dragon and the water, and the flute sings the phoenix down to the sky. The king is so happy, why bother to return to the middle. Yushu returns to the sun in spring, and the Golden Palace has a lot of fun. The back court has not entered the court, and the light chariot passes by night. Laughing out the words between flowers, Jiao came to candle and sing. Don't teach Mingyue to go, keep drunk Chang'e. Xiuhu is fragrant and warm, and the dawn of the screen window is new. The palace flowers compete for laughter, and the pond grass grows darkly in spring. The green trees hear the birds singing, and the brothels see the dancing people. Zhaoyang Tao Liyue and Luo Qi are on a blind date. In Mingguang today, we still have to travel together. The spring breeze opens the Purple Palace, and Tianle descends to the Pearl Tower. Yanwu knows all about cleverness, and Jiaoge is half ashamed. I feel more pity for flowers and moonlit nights, and the maid laughs and hides the hook. The plum blossoms are exhausted in the cold snow, and the willows return in the spring breeze. Gongying is so charming that she wants to get drunk, and the swallows are still flying. Chi Riming singing seats, new flower dance clothes. Come late to change the color battle, carpe diem is brilliant. The water is green in the Nanxun Hall, and the flower is red in the North Tower. Yingge hears too much liquid, and the phoenix blows around Yingzhou. The plain girl sings the pearls and wears them, and the heaven and the man make colorful flowers. The weather is fine today, so it is advisable to visit Weiyang."
浪漫,李白,系寻阳上崔相涣三首 其二,唐,毛遂不堕井，曾参宁杀人。虚言误公子，投杼惑慈亲。白璧双明月，方知一玉真。虚传一片雨，枉作阳台神。纵为梦里相随去，不是襄王倾国人。,Romantic,Li Bai,It is the second of three poems by Cui Xianghuan on Xunyang,"Mao Sui didn't fall into the well, Zeng Shenning killed people. False words mislead the young master, cast a stick to confuse loving relatives. A white jade and two bright moons, only then can one know the truth of a jade. Falsely spreading a piece of rain is in vain as a balcony god. Even if they go with each other in the dream, they are not from King Xiang."
浪漫,李白,陪从祖济南太守泛鹊山湖三首,唐,初谓鹊山近，宁知湖水遥。此行殊访戴，自可缓归桡。湖阔数千里，湖光摇碧山。湖西正有月，独送李膺还。水入北湖去，舟从南浦回。遥看鹊山转，却似送人来。,Romantic,Li Bai,Three Poems Accompanying the Patriarch Jinan Taishou Pan Queshan Lake,"At the beginning, it was said that the magpie mountain was near, but Ning knew that the lake was far away. This trip is a special visit to Dai, so I can return to the radius slowly. The lake is thousands of miles wide, and the light of the lake shakes the mountains. There is a moon in the west of the lake, and Li Ying is sent back alone. The water goes into the North Lake, and the boat returns from Nanpu. Looking at the magpie mountain from a distance, it seems to be sending someone away."
浪漫,李白,陪侍郎叔游洞庭醉后三首,唐,今日竹林宴，我家贤侍郎。三杯容小阮，醉后发清狂。船上齐桡乐，湖心泛月归。白鸥闲不去，争拂酒筵飞。刬却君山好，平铺湘水流。巴陵无限酒，醉杀洞庭秋。,Romantic,Li Bai,Accompanying the waiter uncle to visit the Dongting Drunken Three Poems,"Today's bamboo forest feast, my family's virtuous servant. Three cups allow Xiaoruan to go mad after drunk. The boat is full of joy, and the center of the lake is full of moonlight. The white gulls can't go idle, fighting for wine and feasting. But Junshan is good, and the Xiangshui flow is flat. Baling unlimited wine, drunk to kill Dongting autumn."

The white clouds are still scattered, and the bright moon falls on whose home. Today I am carrying Xie prostitutes, shouting and screaming at the crowd. If you want to report to Dongshan guest, switch to sweep the white clouds."
浪漫,李白,越女词五首,唐,长干吴儿女，眉目艳新月。屐上足如霜，不着鸦头袜。吴儿多白皙，好为荡舟剧。卖眼掷春心，折花调行客。耶溪采莲女，见客棹歌回。笑入荷花去，佯羞不出来。东阳素足女，会稽素舸郎。相看月未堕，白地断肝肠。镜湖水如月，耶溪女似雪。新妆荡新波，光景两奇绝。,Romantic,Li Bai,Five Poems of Yue Nu,"The sons and daughters of Changgan Wu have bright eyebrows and crescent moons. The feet on the clogs are like frost, and there are no crow's socks. Wu'er is so fair, it's good for a boating drama. Show off your eyes and throw your heart, and fold flowers to tune travelers. Yexi picks lotus girls, sees the guests and sings back. Laughing into the lotus, pretending not to be ashamed. A Suzu girl from Dongyang, Su Gelang from Kuaiji. Look at the moon not falling, and the heart is broken in vain. The water in Jinghu Lake is like the moon, and the girl in Yexi is like snow. The new make-up is new, and the scene is amazing."
浪漫,李白,横江词六首 其二,唐,海潮南去过浔阳，牛渚由来险马当。横江欲渡风波恶，一水牵愁万里长。横江西望阻西秦，汉水东连扬子津。白浪如山那可渡，狂风愁杀峭帆人。海神来过恶风回，浪打天门石壁开。浙江八月何如此，涛似连山喷雪来。横江馆前津吏迎，向余东指海云生。郎今欲渡缘何事，如此风波不可行。,Romantic,Li Bai,The second of six poems by Hengjiang,"Hai Chaonan has been to Xunyang, and the origin of Niuzhu is dangerous. The Hengjiang River wants to cross the storm, and the water is long and sorrowful. The Hengjiang River looks to the west to block the Western Qin Dynasty, and the Han River connects to the Yangtze River in the east. The white waves are like mountains that can be crossed, and the strong wind will kill the sailors. When the sea god came, the bad wind came back, and the waves hit the gate of heaven and the stone wall and opened it. How is it like this in August in Zhejiang, the waves are like mountains spraying snow. The Tianjin officials in front of the Hengjiang Pavilion greeted him and pointed to Hai Yunsheng to Yu Dong. Why does Lang Jin want to cross over? Such a turmoil is not feasible."
浪漫,李白,横江词六首,唐,人道横江好，侬道横江恶。一风三日吹倒山，白浪高于瓦官阁。月晕天风雾不开，海鲸东蹙百川回。惊波一起三山动，公无渡河归去来。,Romantic,Li Bai,Six poems by Hengjiang,"Humans say that Hengjiang is good, but Nong says that Hengjiang is evil. One wind blows down the mountain for three days, and the white waves are higher than Waguan Pavilion. When the moon is halo, the wind and fog cannot leave, and the sea whales frown eastward and the rivers return. Shock waves and three mountains move together, and the public does not cross the river to return."
浪漫,李白,永王东巡歌十一首,唐,永王正月东出师，天子遥分龙虎旗。楼船一举风波静，江汉翻为雁鹜池。三川北虏乱如麻，四海南奔似永嘉。但用东山谢安石，为君谈笑静胡沙。雷鼓嘈嘈喧武昌，云旗猎猎过寻阳。秋毫不犯三吴悦，春日遥看五色光。龙蟠虎踞帝王州，帝子金陵访古丘。春风试暖昭阳殿，明月还过鳷鹊楼。二帝巡游俱未回，五陵松柏使人哀。诸侯不救河南地，更喜贤王远道来。丹阳北固是吴关，画出楼台云水间。千岩烽火连沧海，两岸旌旗绕碧山。王出三山按五湖，楼船跨海次陪都。战舰森森罗虎士，征帆一一引龙驹。长风挂席势难回，海动山倾古月摧。君看帝子浮江日，何似龙骧出峡来。祖龙浮海不成桥，汉武寻阳空射蛟。我王楼舰轻秦汉，却似文皇欲渡辽。帝宠贤王入楚关，扫清江汉始应还。初从云梦开朱邸，更取金陵作小山。试借君王玉马鞭，指挥戎虏坐琼筵。南风一扫胡尘静，西入长安到日边。,Romantic,Li Bai,Eleven Songs of King Yong's East Tour,"King Yong left his army in the first month of the first lunar month, and the emperor divided the dragon and tiger banners. The buildings and boats were calm in one fell swoop, and Jianghan was turned into a wild goose pond. The northern captives in Sanchuan are in chaos, and the four seas are running south like Yongjia. But use Dongshan Xie Anshi to talk and laugh with Jing Husha for the king. Thunder and drums are noisy in Wuchang, and clouds and flags are hunting across Xunyang. Autumn does not offend Sanwu Yue, and spring sees five-color light from a distance. Dragons and tigers occupy the emperor's state, and the emperor's son Jinling visits the ancient hills. The spring breeze tries to warm Zhaoyang Hall, and the bright moon passes by the Magpie Tower. The two emperors did not return from their tours, and the pines and cypresses of the Wulings made people mourn. The princes did not save the land of Henan, but preferred the wise king to come from afar. Danyang Beigu is Wuguan, which draws towers, towers, clouds and water. Qianyan beacon fires connect the sea, and the flags on both sides of the strait surround Bishan. The king went out of the three mountains and followed the five lakes, and the buildings and boats crossed the sea to accompany the capital. The battleships are full of tigers and warriors, and the sails are used to attract the dragons and foals one by one. The long wind hangs the seat and it is difficult to return, the sea moves and the mountains fall and the ancient moon destroys it. Look at the day when the emperor's son floats on the river, it looks like a dragon leaping out of the gorge. Zulong floats on the sea and cannot form a bridge, Hanwu seeks the sun and shoots Jiao in the air. My Wang Loujian is light on the Qin and Han Dynasties, but it looks like Emperor Wen wants to cross the Liao Dynasty. The emperor favored the virtuous king to enter Chuguan, and he should return after sweeping Jianghan. At the beginning, Zhudi was opened from Yunmeng, and Jinling was used as a hill. Try to borrow the king's jade horsewhip to command the soldiers to sit at the Qiongyan feast. The south wind swept away Hu Chenjing, and went west to Chang'an to the edge of the sun."
浪漫,李白,上皇西巡南京歌十首,唐,胡尘轻拂建章台，圣主西巡蜀道来。剑壁门高五千尺，石为楼阁九天开。九天开出一成都，万户千门入画图。草树云山如锦绣，秦川得及此间无。华阳春树号新丰，行入新都若旧宫。柳色未饶秦地绿，花光不减上阳红。谁道君王行路难，六龙西幸万人欢。地转锦江成渭水，天回玉垒作长安。万国同风共一时，锦江何谢曲江池。石镜更明天上月，后宫亲得照蛾眉。濯锦清江万里流，云帆龙舸下扬州。北地虽誇上林苑，南京还有散花楼。锦水东流绕锦城，星桥北挂象天星。四海此中朝圣主，峨眉山下列仙庭。秦开蜀道置金牛，汉水元通星汉流。天子一行遗圣迹，锦城长作帝王州。水绿天青不起尘，风光和暖胜三秦。万国烟花随玉辇，西来添作锦江春。剑阁重关蜀北门，上皇归马若云屯。少帝长安开紫极，双悬日月照乾坤。,Romantic,Li Bai,Ten Songs of the Emperor's West Tour to Nanjing,"Hu Chen flicked Jianzhang Terrace, and the Holy Master came west to tour the Shu Road. The Jianbi Gate is five thousand feet high, and the stone is the nine-day opening of the pavilion. In nine days, all of Chengdu will be opened, and thousands of households will enter the painting. The grass, trees, clouds and mountains are like brocades, and Qin Chuan can't match them here. Huayang Chunshu is called Xinfeng, and entering the new capital is like the old palace. The willow color is not green in the Qin Dynasty, and the flowers are not less red than the sun. Who knows that the king's journey is difficult, but the six dragons and the west are lucky and everyone is happy. Earth turns Jinjiang into Weishui, and sky turns Yulei into Chang'an. When all nations share the same wind, how can Jinjiang thank Qujiangchi? Shi Jing will be more than tomorrow and last month, and the harem will be able to shine on the eyebrows. The Zhuojin Qingjiang River flows for thousands of miles, and the clouds, sails and dragons go down to Yangzhou. Although Beidi boasted about Linyuan, there is also Sanhualou in Nanjing. Jinshui flows eastward around Jincheng, and the star bridge hangs like stars in the north. Among the four seas, the pilgrimage master, the fairy court below Mount Emei. The Qin Dynasty opened the Shu Road and set up the golden bull, and the Han River and the Yuan Tongxing Hanliu. The emperor and his party left the holy relics, and Jincheng became the emperor's state. The water is green, the sky is green and dust-free, and the scenery is warmer than Sanqin. The fireworks of all nations follow the jade chariot, and come from the west to add to the Jinjiang Spring. Jiange re-closed the north gate of Shu, and the emperor returned to Ma Ruoyun. The young emperor Chang'an opened the purple pole, and the sun and the moon hung on both sides to illuminate the universe."
浪漫,李白,送外甥郑灌从军三首,唐,六博争雄好彩来，金盘一掷万人开。丈夫赌命报天子，当斩胡头衣锦回。丈八蛇矛出陇西，弯弧拂箭白猿啼。破胡必用龙韬策，积甲应将熊耳齐。月蚀西方破敌时，及瓜归日未应迟。斩胡血变黄河水，枭首当悬白鹊旗。,Romantic,Li Bai,Sending Nephew Zheng Guan to Join the Army Three Poems,"Six games are competing for supremacy, and the gold plate is thrown to thousands of people. The husband gambled his life to repay the emperor, and he should behead his beard and return his clothes. The Zhangba Snake Spear came out of Longxi, and the white ape cried with an arc of arrows. Long Tao's strategy must be used to break the barbarian, and Xiong Erqi should be used to accumulate armor. When the lunar eclipse breaks the enemy in the west, it is not too late to return to the sun. The blood of the beheaded tiger turns into the water of the Yellow River, and the head of the owl hangs the white magpie flag."
浪漫,李白,陪族叔刑部侍郎晔及中书贾舍人至游洞庭五首,唐,洞庭西望楚江分，水尽南天不见云。日落长沙秋色远，不知何处吊湘君。南湖秋水夜无烟，耐可乘流直上天。且就洞庭赊月色，将船买酒白云边。洛阳才子谪湘川，元礼同舟月下仙。记得长安还欲笑，不知何处是西天。洞庭湖西秋月辉，潇湘江北早鸿飞。醉客满船歌白苧，不知霜露入秋衣。帝子潇湘去不还，空馀秋草洞庭间。淡扫明湖开玉镜，丹青画出是君山。,Romantic,Li Bai,Five Poems of Traveling to Dongting by Minister Lang Ye and Zhongshu Jia Sheren of the Ministry of Punishment,"Dongting looks west at the branch of the Chu River, and the water is exhausted, and there are no clouds in the southern sky. The sunset in Changsha is far away in autumn, I don't know where to hang Xiangjun. There is no smoke at night in the autumn water of Nanhu Lake, and Naike rides the stream straight to the sky. And on the Dongting moonlight on credit, buy the boat to the side of the white clouds. Talented scholars from Luoyang were relegated to Xiangchuan, and Yuan Li was in the same boat as a fairy under the moon. I remember that Chang'an still wanted to laugh, but he didn't know where the west sky was. The autumn moon shines in the west of Dongting Lake, and Hongfei flies in the north of Xiaoxiang River. Drunk guests are full of boats singing white ramie, I don't know if the frost is dew into the autumn clothes. The emperor's son Xiaoxiang will not return, leaving the autumn grass in the Dongting room. Sweeping away the Minghu Lake and opening the jade mirror, the painting is Junshan."
浪漫,李白,别内赴徵三首,唐,王命三徵去未还，明朝离别出吴关。白玉高楼看不见，相思须上望夫山。出门妻子强牵衣，问我西行几日归。归时傥佩黄金印，莫学苏秦不下机。翡翠为楼金作梯，谁人独宿倚门啼。夜坐寒灯连晓月，行行泪尽楚关西。,Romantic,Li Bai,Bie Nei went to collect three poems,"The king ordered the three expeditions to go and did not return, and the Ming Dynasty left Wuguan. The white jade tall building cannot be seen, and Acacia must go to Wangfu Mountain. When I went out, my wife pulled my clothes by force and asked me how many days I would go west.

The sky is cold and the wind is sad, and the night is long and the stars are gone. I can't bear to express my pity, and the dirge is caught out. There are giant fish in Beiming, thousands of miles long. It sprays snow from three mountains upwards and swallows water from hundreds of rivers across. The mausoleum is transported by sea, and the wind rises because of the wind. I watch the sky fly, ninety thousand squares are not enough. The feathers are like shooting stars, and the tigers are in the city. Shouting for help, all the birds are singing at night. During the day, Ziwei, the balance of the three public fortunes. The heaven and the earth are all one, and the four seas are calm. Asking what this is for, I said that Chu recruited troops. After crossing Lu and in May, we will go to Yunnan to conquer. A cowardly soldier is not a soldier, and it is difficult for Yan Fang to travel far. Don't be strict with the trombone, the sun and the moon are miserable. After weeping and blood, the heart is broken and the two are silent. A trapped animal is a tiger, and a poor bait is a whale. If you don't return once in a thousand times, how can you live forever if you devote yourself to it? How to dance relatives, one makes Miao Ping. The ugly girl came to imitate and frightened the neighbors at home. Shouling lost his original step and killed the Handan people laughingly. A brilliant song, dizzying innocence. The thorns make the monkeys, and it takes three years to waste energy. Success is useless, beautiful and beautiful. Great Yasi Wenwang, the sound of praise has collapsed for a long time. Ande Ying was middle-class, and he became an ax with one swing. Entering the state of Chu with jade, seeing and doubting what the ancients heard. Liangbao was finally abandoned, and he sacrificed three times to the king in vain. Zhimu avoids cutting first, Fanglan mourns and sets herself on fire. The sky is full of damage, and Shen Mingdao is a group. The East China Sea sinks into the clear water, and Xiguan rides on the purple clouds. Lulian and Zhushi can be traced to Qingfen. Yanchen cried bitterly in the past, and May flew to Qiushuang. The concubine's name is the sky, and the strong wind hits the whole hall. Sincerity has a feeling, good fortune turns into sadness. But I am so innocent, far away from the golden palace. Floating clouds cover the purple door, and it is difficult to return to the light in the daytime. The sand is dirty and the pearl is filthy, and the grass is lonely. Since ancient times, we have sighed together, weeping and weeping in the air. The lonely orchid grows in a secluded garden, and all the grasses are gone. Although it shines in the sun and Chunhui, it saddens Gao Qiuyue again. The flying frost is pattering early, and the green is afraid of resting. If there is no breeze to blow, for whom will the fragrance be sent? Climbing high and looking at the sea, how long is the world. Frost is surrounded by autumn, the wind blows and the wilderness is cold. Prosperity flows eastward, and everything is turbulent. The daylight hides the brilliance, and the floating clouds have no fixed end. The sparrow nests in the phoenix tree, and the mandarin luan nests in the thorn. And back and forth, sword song travel is difficult. The phoenix does not peck millet when it is hungry, but only eats Langgan. How can I compete with a flock of chickens for a meal. In the morning, the Kunqiu trees sing, and in the evening, the mainstay of drinking is turbulent. Going back to Feihai is far away, and I sleep alone in the frost and cold. Fortunately, I met Wang Zijin and made friends with Qingyun. Wynn has not been rewarded, so I can't help but sigh. In the morning, you will enjoy Ziyihai, and in the evening, you will wear Danxia clothes. Wave your hand like a tree, and brush the west sun. The clouds lie on the eight poles, and the jade face is already a thousand frost. Fluttering into nothing, Jishou prays to the emperor. Call me Taisu, and the jade cup bestows fine wine. Long live a meal, why return home. Always go with the long wind, flying freely in the sky. Shake the descendants of double white gulls, and fly to the Cangjiang River. It is advisable to have sex with people from the sea, but Yiyun Heyou. Stay in Shayue, and play Chunzhou along Fangfang. I am also a person who washes my heart, forgetting the opportunity to travel with you. Zhou Mu's eight wild ideas, Han Emperor Wan Chengzun. If you don't have an extreme desire for lust and pleasure, you can talk about being a hero. The Queen Mother is feasting in the West Sea, and the North Palace invites Shangyuan. Yaoshui heard the last song, but the jade cup was empty. The miraculous signs become weeds, and the soul is sad for thousands of years. The green radish is luxuriant, winding around the pine and cypress branches. The grass and trees are entrusted, and the cold weather does not change. Naihe is peachy, sitting and sighing the poems of Feifei. The jade face is bright red, and the cloud hair is not plain silk. The gentleman's kindness is over, what will the concubine do. The wilderness is soaring, and all things are withered. Floating clouds cover the decadent sun, and flood waves vibrate the big ravines. The dragon and the phoenix get rid of the bamboo, and the fluttering will Antuo. Go and ride the white horse, chant the field huo in the empty mountain. One hundred and forty years, the country looks so impressive. There are five phoenix buildings faintly, and E'e crosses three rivers. Princes and princes are like stars and moons, and guests are like clouds and smoke. In the golden palace of cockfighting, beside Cuju Yaotai. Move to shake the day, command back to the blue sky. When Tu Hexi suddenly lost his way and abandoned the donation. Only Yang holds the halberd, and the grass is too mysterious in retreat. Peach blossoms bloom in the East Garden, smiling and boasting about the day. Occasionally, the east wind is prosperous, and this sun is born. There is no beauty, but I am afraid that the flowers will not be real. The dragon and the fire fly like a dragon, and the scattered and early lose each other. You know Nanshan pine, and you are independent from Xiao Bian. Qin Huang pressed the sword, and he was so angry that he shook his majesty. Patrol the sea day by day, drive stones and drive Cangjin. Conquering the empty nine universes, making a bridge and injuring thousands of people. But if you ask for Pengdao medicine, you don't think of farming and spring. It is a tragedy for thousands of years to do your best. The beauty came out of the southern country, shining like a hibiscus. The white teeth will never come out, and the heart is empty and self-sufficient. The reason is that the purple palace ladies are jealous of the green moth eyebrows. Going back to Xiaoxiang, there is nothing sad to meditate on. To the east of Wutai in Song Dynasty, the savage got Yanshi. It is praised as a treasure in the world, but it is Zhao Wangbi. Zhao Bi has no black phosphorus, and Yan Shi is not chaste. There are many mistakes in popular customs, but you don't know jade and min. Empress Yin was in chaos, and Chu Huai was also in a coma. The barbarian sheep are all over the middle and the wild, and the scorpions are full of tall gates. Bi Gan died of remonstrance, and Qu Ping fled to Xiangyuan. He Wanluan at the mouth of the tiger, and her daughter Kong Chanyuan. Peng Xian has disappeared for a long time, who cares about this. The flow of youth is turbulent, and Zhu Ming suddenly returns to thinness. I can't bear to look at the autumn pendants, but why are they fluttering. The light and wind destroy the orchid, and the white dew sprinkles the sunflower. The beauty is beyond my expectations, and the vegetation is falling. There were so many warring states, and the wars were chaotic. Zhao Yi fought with two tigers, and the Jin Dynasty was divided into six ministers. Treacherous ministers want to steal their position and build up a party and a group of themselves. Sure enough, Tian Chengzi would kill Qi Jun once. Leaning on the sword to climb the high platform, you can see off the spring eyes leisurely. Cang hazel covers the hills, Qiongcao hides deep valleys. The phoenix sings in the West Sea, but there are no precious trees in the collection. The place where Lu Side lives is filled with tens of thousands of people under Artemisia. The wind of Jin has fallen, and the poor are weeping. Qi Se played the East Yin, and Qin Xian played the West Yin. Generosity moves the soul and makes people become licentious. He is a beautiful and evil son, and Wan Luan came to find him. Smile and double white jade, and then sing a thousand gold. Precious colors are not expensive, but cherish the light and sink. An knows Zixia guest, Yaotai Ming Suqin. Yue Ke picks pearls and leads them out of Nanyu. The clear brilliance shines on the sea and the moon, and the beautiful price pours into the imperial capital. Xian Jun Jun presses the sword, Huai Baokong makes a long cry. The eyes of the fish look back at each other again, and the heart becomes more troubled. The Yu family is endowed with myriad changes, and the big and small have their own support. Zhou Zhou is also innocent, Liu He can't hide it. I would like to take the wings of all birds and fly to the Yellow River. The flyer does not care about me, and he will return home with a sigh. I went to Wushanzhu, looking for Gudeng Balcony. The colorful clouds in the sky are gone, and the wind is coming from afar. The goddess has been gone for a long time, and King Xiang is here. The licentiousness has been replaced, and the woodcutters and shepherds are sad. Weeping for Luqi, mourning for Susi. Lu Qi has a north and a south, and the silk is easy to change. As it is, life has no set date. Tian Dou competes with each other, and the guests gain and lose each other. There are many ups and downs in the world, and the way is easy. Doujiu is strong and promises, but Cunxin is self-confident. Zhang Chen was extinguished, and Xiao Zhu was separated from the stars. All the birds gather in Rongke, and the poor fish guard the dry pond. Sigh sigh lost power off, frequently asked what rules."
浪漫,李白,秋浦歌十七首,唐,秋浦长似秋，萧条使人愁。客愁不可度，行上东大楼。正西望长安，下见江水流。寄言向江水，汝意忆侬不。遥传一掬泪，为我达扬州。秋浦猿夜愁，黄山堪白头。清溪非陇水，翻作断肠流。欲去不得去，薄游成久游。何年是归日，雨泪下孤舟。秋浦锦驼鸟，人间天上稀。山鸡羞渌水，不敢照毛衣。两鬓入秋浦，一朝飒已衰。猿声催白发，长短尽成丝。秋浦多白猿，超腾若飞雪。牵引条上儿，饮弄水中月。愁作秋浦客，强看秋浦花。山川如剡县，风日似长沙。醉上山公马，寒歌宁戚牛。空吟白石烂，泪满黑貂裘。秋浦千重岭，水车岭最奇。天倾欲堕石，水拂寄生枝。江祖一片石，青天扫画屏。题诗留万古，绿字锦苔生。千千石楠树，万万女贞林。山山白鹭满，涧涧白猿吟。君莫向秋浦，猿声碎客心。逻人横鸟道，江祖出鱼梁。水急客舟疾，山花拂面香。水如一匹练，此地即平天。耐可乘明月，看花上酒船。渌水净素月，月明白鹭飞。郎听采菱女，一道夜歌归。炉火照天地，红星乱紫烟。赧郎明月夜，歌曲动寒川。白发三千丈，缘愁似个长。不知明镜里，何处得秋霜。秋浦田舍翁，采鱼水中宿。妻子张白鹇，结罝映深竹。桃波一步地，了了语声闻。闇与山僧别，低头礼白云。,Romantic,Li Bai,Seventeen Qiupu Songs,"Qiupu grows like autumn, and the depression makes people worry. The guest was so worried that he went to the East Building. Looking west at Chang'an, you can see the river flowing down. Send words to Jiangshui, Ru Yiyi remembers Lennon. Spread a tear from afar, reach Yangzhou for me. The ape in Qiupu is sad at night, and Huangshan can grow old. Qingxi is not a long river, it turns into a heartbroken stream. If you want to go but can't go, thin travel becomes long travel. What year is the return to the sun, and the rain and tears flow down the lonely boat. The autumn Pu brocade ostrich is rare in the world and in the sky. The pheasant is ashamed of the water, and dare not shine on the sweater. When the temples enter Qiupu, the rustling has faded once. The sound of the ape urges the white hair to be as long as it is short. There are many white apes in Qiupu, soaring like flying snow. On the traction bar, drink the moon in the water. Worry about being a guest of Qiupu, but look at the flowers of Qiupu. The mountains and rivers are like Shan County, and the wind and sun are like Changsha. Drunk up the mountain stallion, cold song rather Qi Niu. The white stone is rotten, and the sable fur is full of tears. Qiupu Qianchongling and Shuicheling are the most amazing. The sky is about to fall to the rock, and the water is blowing the parasitic branches. Jiangzu is a piece of stone, and the blue sky sweeps the screen. The inscribed poems will last forever, and the green characters will grow with brocade moss. Thousands of heather trees, thousands of privet forests. The mountains and mountains are full of egrets, and the streams and streams are full of white apes. Jun Mo Xiang Qiupu, the sound of ape breaks the heart of the guest. The lover crosses the bird's path, and Jiang Zu comes out of the fish beam. The water is urgent, the boat is sick, and the mountain flowers are fragrant. The water is like a piece of water, and the sky is flat here. Naike takes the bright moon to watch the flowers on the wine boat. The Lushui is pure and the moon is clear, and the moon is clear and the egrets fly. Lang listens to Cailing girl, and returns home with a night song. The fire shines on the sky and the earth, and the red stars are chaotic and purple. On the moonlit night of Nanlang, the song moves the cold river. The white hair is three thousand feet long, and the fate seems to be long. I don't know where to get autumn frost in the mirror. Qiupu Tianshe Weng lives in the water while picking fish. His wife Zhang Baixun married Shenzhu. Step by step, Taobo spoke the words and heard the sound. Say goodbye to the mountain monk in secret, and bow your head to salute Baiyun."
浪漫,李白,赠范金卿二首,唐,君子枉清盼，不知东走迷。离家来几月，络纬鸣中闺。桃李君不言，攀花愿成蹊。那能吐芳信，惠好相招携。我有结绿珍，久藏浊水泥。时人弃此物，乃与燕珉齐。摭拭欲赠之，申眉路无梯。辽东惭白豕，楚客羞山鸡。徒有献芹心，终流泣玉啼。祗应自索漠，留舌示山妻。范宰不买名，弦歌对前楹。为邦默自化，日觉冰壶清。百里鸡犬静，千庐机杼鸣。浮人少荡析，爱客多逢迎。游子睹嘉政，因之听颂声。,Romantic,Li Bai,Present two poems to Fan Jinqing,"A gentleman looks forward in vain, not knowing where he is going astray. After being away from home for a few months, Luo Weiming is in her boudoir. Mr. Tao and Li don’t say anything, Panhua is willing to become a trail. That can spit out the letter, and Huihao will recruit and cooperate with each other. I have Jieluzhen, which has been hiding muddy cement for a long time. When people abandoned this thing, they were on par with Yan Min. If you want to give it as a gift, there is no ladder on Shenmei Road. Liaodong is ashamed of the white pig, and the guest of Chu is ashamed of the pheasant. In vain, there is a heart of dedication, and finally weeping and crying. You should only leave your tongue to show your wife from Saumer. Fan Zai doesn't buy a name, and the string song is on the front couplet. For the self-transformation of Bangmo, the day feels the curling is clear. A hundred miles of chickens and dogs are quiet, and a thousand cottages are singing. Floating people seldom sway and analyze, love customers more to cater to. The wanderer sees Jiazheng, so he listens to the sound of praise."
浪漫,李白,玉真公主别馆苦雨赠卫尉张卿二首,唐,秋坐金张馆，繁阴昼不开。空烟迷雨色，萧飒望中来。翳翳昏垫苦，沈沈忧恨催。清秋何以慰，白酒盈吾杯。吟咏思管乐，此人已成灰。独酌聊自勉，谁贵经纶才。弹剑谢公子，无鱼良可哀。苦雨思白日，浮云何由卷。稷卨和天人，阴阳乃骄蹇。秋霖剧倒井，昏雾横绝巘。欲往咫尺涂，遂成山川限。潨潨奔溜闻，浩浩惊波转。泥沙塞中途，牛马不可辨。饥从漂母食，闲缀羽陵简。园家逢秋蔬，藜藿不满眼。蟏蛸结思幽，蟋蟀伤褊浅。厨灶无青烟，刀机生绿藓。投箸解鹔鹴，换酒醉北堂。丹徒布衣者，慷慨未可量。何时黄金盘，一斛荐槟榔。功成拂衣去，摇曳沧洲傍。,Romantic,Li Bai,Two Poems Presented by Wei Wei Zhang Qing by Bitter Rain in Princess Yuzhen's Villa,"Sitting in the Jinzhang Pavilion in autumn, it is not open during the cloudy day. The sky was filled with smoke and rain, and Xiao Sa fell in love with it. Yiyi is faint and bitter, and is reminded of deep sorrow and hatred. How comforting is Qingqiu, my cup is full of white wine. Chanting and thinking about wind music, this person has become ashes. Drinking alone and talking about self-encouragement, who is more economical? Master Xie with flicking the sword, there is no fish to be sad. Bitter rain thinks about the day, why do the clouds roll. Ji Xie and heaven and man, yin and yang are arrogant. Qiulin's drama fell into the well, and the fog and fog swept across. If you want to paint as close as you can, it will become the limit of mountains and rivers. Rushing and rushing to hear the news, Haohao was shocked. In the middle of the mud plug, cattle and horses cannot be distinguished. Hungry from the drifting mother to eat, leisurely adorned with Yuling bamboo slips. When the garden is full of autumn vegetables, the quinoa is full of eyes. Weeds form knots and miss you, and crickets hurt shallow. There is no green smoke from the kitchen stove, and green moss grows on the knife machine. Toss the chopsticks to untie the pheasant, and exchange for the drunk Beitang. The generosity of Dantu civilians is immeasurable. When is the golden plate, a dendrobium recommends betel nuts. After success, he flicked his clothes and swayed beside Cangzhou."
浪漫,李白,赠韦秘书子春二首,唐,谷口郑子真，躬耕在岩石。高名动京师，天下皆籍籍。斯人竟不起，云卧从所适。苟无济代心，独善亦何益。惟君家世者，偃息逢休明。谈天信浩荡，说剑纷纵横。谢公不徒然，起来为苍生。秘书何寂寂，无乃羁豪英。且复归碧山，安能恋金阙。旧宅樵渔地，蓬蒿已应没。却顾女几峰，胡颜见云月。徒为风尘苦，一官已白须。气同万里合，访我来琼都。披云睹青天，扪虱话良图。留侯将绮里，出处未云殊。终与安社稷，功成去五湖。,Romantic,Li Bai,Two Poems to Secretary Wei Zichun,"Zheng Zizhen, Taniguchi, plowed on the rock. The high name moves the capital, and everyone in the world is a native. The Sri Lankan people can't afford it, and the clouds lie down. If there is no aid to replace the heart, it is no good to be alone. But those who are from the royal family will die every time they die. Talking about the sky is mighty, talking about swords. Xie Gong is not in vain, he rose up for the sake of the common people. He Jiji, the secretary, is nothing but a hero. And return to Bishan, An Neng loves Jinque. In the old house for firewood and fishing, the basil has disappeared. But Gu Nu Jifeng, Hu Yan sees Yunyue. It's just suffering from the wind and dust, and an official has a white beard. Qi is the same as thousands of miles away, visit me to Qiongdu. See the blue sky through the clouds, touch the lice and talk about good pictures. Liu Hou Jiang Qili, the source is not different. In the end, I will be with Ansheji, and I will go to Wuhu after success."
浪漫,李白,赠韦侍御黄裳二首,唐,太华生长松，亭亭凌霜雪。天与百尺高，岂为微飙折。桃李卖阳艳，路人行且迷。春光扫地尽，碧叶成黄泥。愿君学长松，慎勿作桃李。受屈不改心，然后知君子。见君乘骢马，知上太山道。此地果摧轮，全身以为宝。我如丰年玉，弃置秋田草。但勖冰壶心，无为叹衰老。,Romantic,Li Bai,Presenting two poems of Huang Chang to Wei Shiyu,"Taihua grows pine, and the pavilion is frosty and snowy. How can the sky be as high as a hundred feet? Peaches and plums are sold in the sun, and passers-by are fascinated. The spring is gone, and the green leaves are turned into yellow mud. May you learn from the pine, and be careful not to be peaches and plums. If you don't change your mind after being wronged, then you will know a gentleman. Seeing you riding a horse, you will know how to go to Mount Tai. If the fruit of this place destroys the wheel, the whole body is regarded as a treasure. I am like a jade in a good year, abandoning autumn field grass. But Xu curling heart, doing nothing to lament aging."
浪漫,李白,赠从弟南平太守之遥二首,唐,少年不得意，落魄无安居。愿随任公子，欲钓吞舟鱼。常时饮酒逐风景，壮心遂与功名疏。兰生谷底人不锄，云在高山空卷舒。汉家天子驰驷马，赤军蜀道迎相如。天门九重谒圣人，龙颜一解四海春。彤庭左右呼万岁，拜贺明主收沈沦。翰林秉笔回英眄，麟阁峥嵘谁可见。承恩初入银台门，著书独在金銮殿。龙钩雕镫白玉鞍，象床绮席黄金盘。当时笑我微贱者，却来请谒为交欢。一朝谢病游江海，畴昔相知几人在。前门长揖后门关，今日结交明日改。爱君山岳心不移，随君云雾迷所为。梦得池塘生春草，使我长价登楼诗。别后遥传临海作，可见羊何共和之。东平与南平，今古两步兵。素心爱美酒，不是顾专城。谪官桃源去，寻花几处行。秦人如旧识，出户笑相迎。,Romantic,Li Bai,Presented to my younger brother Nanping Taishou Zhiyao two poems,"The teenager is not proud, and there is no safe place to live. Willing to follow any son, wanting to catch a boat-swallowing fish. Often drinking to chase the scenery, the strong heart will be separated from the fame. People at the bottom of the Lansheng Valley don't hoe, and the clouds roll up in the mountains. The emperor of the Han family gallops on four horses, and the Red Army welcomes Xiangru on the Shu road. Tianmen Jiuzhong paid homage to the saints, and Long Yan explained the spring of the world. The left and right of Tongting shouted long live, and congratulated the Ming Lord on accepting sinking. Hanlin Bingbi returns to Yingkun, who can see the towering Lin Pavilion. Cheng En entered the Yintai Gate for the first time, and wrote books alone in the Jinluan Hall. The white jade saddle with carved stirrups on the dragon hook is like a golden plate on the bed. Those who laughed at me at the time came to invite me to have sex. Once he was sick and traveled the rivers and seas, how many people he knew in the past were there. The front door is long and the back door is closed. Make friends today and change tomorrow. I love you, my heart is unwavering, and I will do whatever you want. I dreamed that spring grass was growing in the pond, which made me write poems on the stairs. After the farewell, it was spread to Linhai as a work, which shows how the sheep are reconciled. Dongping and Nanping, the ancient and modern infantry. Su Xin loves good wine, not Gu Zhuancheng. The exiled official went to Taoyuan, looking for flowers in a few places. The Qin people greeted each other with a smile as if they were old acquaintances."
浪漫,李白,赠张相镐二首,唐,神器难窃弄，天狼窥紫宸。六龙迁白日，四海暗胡尘。昊穹降元宰，君子方经纶。澹然养浩气，歘起持大钧。秀骨象山岳，英谋合鬼神。佐汉解鸿门，生唐为后身。拥旄秉金钺，伐鼓乘朱轮。虎将如雷霆，总戎向东巡。诸侯拜马首，猛士骑鲸鳞。泽被鱼鸟悦，令行草木春。圣智不失时，建功及良辰。丑虏安足纪，可贻帼与巾。倒泻溟海珠，尽为入幕珍。冯异献赤伏，邓生倏来臻。庶同昆阳举，再睹汉仪新。昔为管将鲍，中奔吴隔秦。一生欲报主，百代思荣亲。其事竟不就，哀哉难重陈。卧病宿松山，苍茫空四邻。风云激壮志，枯槁惊常伦。闻君自天来，目张气益振。亚夫得剧孟，敌国空无人。扪虱对桓公，愿得论悲辛。大块方噫气，何辞鼓青蘋。斯言傥不合，归老汉江滨。本家陇西人，先为汉边将。功略盖天地，名飞青云上。苦战竟不侯，富年颇惆怅。世传崆峒勇，气激金风壮。英烈遗厥孙，百代神犹王。十五观奇书，作赋凌相如。龙颜惠殊宠，麟阁凭天居。晚途未云已，蹭蹬遭谗毁。想像晋末时，崩腾胡尘起。衣冠陷锋镝，戎虏盈朝市。石勒窥神州，刘聪劫天子。抚剑夜吟啸，雄心日千里。誓欲斩鲸鲵，澄清洛阳水。六合洒霖雨，万物无彫枯。我挥一杯水，自笑何区区。因人耻成事，贵欲决良图。灭虏不言功，飘然陟蓬壶。惟有安期舄，留之沧海隅。,Romantic,Li Bai,Present two songs by Jang Sang-ho,"Artifacts are difficult to steal, and Sirius peeps at Zichen. The six dragons move into the daylight, and the four seas are dark and dusty. Hao Qiong surrendered Yuan Zai, the gentleman Fang Jinglun. Indulge in arrogance, hold a big jun. The beautiful bones are like mountains, and Ying conspires with ghosts and gods. Zuo Han Jie Hongmen, born Tang as the descendant. Yongyan holds a golden axe, beats drums and rides a red wheel. The tiger will be like thunder, and the general army will patrol the east. The princes worship the head of the horse, and the warrior rides the scale of the whale. The lake is happy with the fish and birds, and the grass and trees are in spring. The wisdom is not lost, the meritorious service and the good time. The ugly prisoner has enough time, but he can bring a woman and a scarf. The pearls poured into the sea are all the treasures of entering the curtain. Feng Yi presented Chifu, and Deng Sheng came to Zhen. The concubine and Kunyang held together, and saw Han Yixin again. In the past, he was the Guan Jiangbao, and he went to Wu and separated Qin. I want to repay the Lord all my life, and I want to honor my relatives for a hundred generations. It's so sad that it's hard to repeat. I was sick and stayed in Songshan, surrounded by boundless sky. The wind and the cloud stimulate the ambition, and the haggard frightens Chang Lun. Hearing that you came from the sky, your eyes are open and your Qi is invigorating. Yafu is in Jumeng, and the enemy country is empty. To Huan Gong, the louse is willing to talk about sorrow and hardship. The big square sighs, why don't you talk about green apples. If Si Yan doesn't agree with each other, it belongs to the old man Jiang Bin. His family is from Longxi, and he was first a general of the Han Dynasty. The merits cover the world slightly, and the name is flying on the blue clouds. After a bitter battle, the rich year is quite melancholy. It is handed down from generation to generation that Kongtong is brave, and his spirit is strong and golden. The grandson of the heroes and martyrs, the god of the Eternal King of Judea. Fifteen Guan Qishu, as Fu Ling Xiangru. Long Yanhui is very favored, and Lin Pavilion lives by the sky. It's not cloudy in the evening, and Cengdeng was slandered. Imagine that at the end of the Jin Dynasty, the dust rose. Clothes and crowns are trapped in the front, and soldiers and captives are full of court. Shi Le peeks at Shenzhou, and Liu Cong robs the emperor. Rushing the sword and whistling at night, the ambition is growing day by day. I vow to kill the whale salamander and clarify the Luoyang water. The heaven and earth are sprinkled with rain, and all things will not dry up. I waved a glass of water and laughed at myself. Because people's shame makes things happen, you want to make a good plan. Killing the captives does not speak of merit, but floats in the Penghu. Only Anqi Xi, stay in the corner of the sea."
浪漫,李白,赠友人三首,唐,兰生不当户，别是闲庭草。夙被霜露欺，红荣已先老。谬接瑶华枝，结根君王池。顾无馨香美，叨沐清风吹。馀芳若可佩，卒岁长相随。袖中赵匕首，买自徐夫人。玉匣闭霜雪，经燕复历秦。其事竟不捷，沦落归沙尘。持此愿投赠，与君同急难。荆卿一去后，壮士多摧残。长号易水上，为我扬波澜。凿井当及泉，张帆当济川。廉夫唯重义，骏马不劳鞭。人生贵相知，何必金与钱。慢世薄功业，非无胸中画。谑浪万古贤，以为儿童剧。立产如广费，匡君怀长策。但苦山北寒，谁知道南宅。岁酒上逐风，霜鬓两边白。蜀主思孔明，晋家望安石。时人列五鼎，谈笑期一掷。虎伏被胡尘，渔歌游海滨。弊裘耻妻嫂，长剑托交亲。夫子秉家义，群公难与邻。莫持西江水，空许东溟臣。他日青云去，黄金报主人。,Romantic,Li Bai,three songs for friends,"Lan Sheng is not a householder, don't be a garden grass. Su was deceived by Shuanglu, and Hongrong was already old. Misconnecting the Yaohua branch, forming the root of the king's pool. Gu Wuxin is fragrant and beautiful, and the cool breeze blows. Yu Fang is admirable, and she will be with her when she dies. The Zhao dagger in the sleeve was bought from Mrs. Xu. The jade box is closed with frost and snow, and the Qin Dynasty was restored by Yan. The matter was not successful, and it was reduced to the dust. Holding this wish to cast a gift, we are in the same crisis as you. After Jing Qing left, many strong men were destroyed. The trombone is easy on the water, making waves for me. Drilling wells should serve as springs, and Zhang Fan should serve as Jichuan. A honest husband only values righteousness, and a horse does not work hard. Knowing each other is important in life, why bother with gold and money. Slowing down the world and making little achievements is not a picture in the chest. Jilang Wanguxian thinks it is a children's play. Establishing property is like widening expenses, Kuang Jun has a long-term plan. But the bitter mountain is cold in the north, who knows the south house. The old wine is chasing the wind, and the frost is white on both sides. The master of Shu thinks of Kong Ming, and the family of Jin looks at Anshi. At that time, people lined up five tripods, talking and laughing all the time. The tiger is covered by the tiger dust, and the fisherman's song swims on the seashore. Disgraceful Qiu shames his wife and sister-in-law, and entrusts the long sword to his relatives. The master upholds the righteousness of the family, and it is difficult for the public to live with neighbors. Don't hold the water of the West River, and let the ministers of Dongming empty. In the future, Qingyun will go, and the gold will report to the master."
浪漫,李白,留别贾舍人至二首,唐,大梁白云起，飘飖来南洲。裴回苍梧野，十见罗浮秋。鳌抃山海倾，四溟扬洪流。意欲托孤凤，从之摩天游。凤苦道路难，翱翔还昆丘。不肯衔我去，哀鸣惭不周。远客谢主人，明珠难暗投。拂拭倚天剑，西登岳阳楼。长啸万里风，扫清胸中忧。谁念刘越石，化为绕指柔。秋风吹胡霜，凋此檐下芳。折芳怨岁晚，离别悽以伤。谬攀青琐贤，延我于北堂。君为长沙客，我独之夜郎。劝此一杯酒，岂惟道路长。割珠两分赠，寸心贵不忘。何必儿女仁，相看泪成行。,Romantic,Li Bai,Farewell to Jiasheren to the Second Poem,"The girders and white clouds rise, floating to Nanzhou. When Pei returned to Cangwuye, he saw Luo Fuqiu ten times. The mountains and seas of Aoba are tilted, and the four seas are full of torrents. I want to entrust the lonely phoenix to travel in the sky. The phoenix suffers from a difficult road, so it flies back to Kunqiu. He refuses to take me with him, and he is ashamed to whine. A guest from afar thanks the master, the pearl is hard to cast secretly. Wipe the Yitian sword, and go west to Yueyang Tower. Shouting thousands of miles of wind, sweeping away the worries in the chest. Whoever reads Liu Yueshi turns into soft fingers. The autumn wind blows Hushuang, and the fragrance under the eaves withers. Zhefang complains about the late age, and the parting is miserable. Misplaced Qing Suoxian and extended me to Beitang. You are a guest from Changsha, and I am a lonely Yelang. Persuading this glass of wine is not only a long way. Two points for cutting beads, don't forget your heart. Why benevolent sons and daughters, look at each other and cry together."
浪漫,李白,送裴十八图南归嵩山二首,唐,何处可为别，长安青绮门。胡姬招素手，延客醉金樽。临当上马时，我独与君言。风吹芳兰折，日没鸟雀喧。举手指飞鸿，此情难具论。同归无早晚，颍水有清源。君思颍水绿，忽复归嵩岑。归时莫洗耳，为我洗其心。洗心得真情，洗耳徒买名。谢公终一起，相与济苍生。,Romantic,Li Bai,Two Poems Sending Pei Shibatu South to Songshan,"Where can we say goodbye? Chang'an Qingqi Gate. Orchid beckons plain hands, and Yanke is drunk with gold. When I got on the horse, I talked to the king alone. The wind blows the fragrant orchids, and there are no birds and birds in the day. It's hard to say if you raise your finger to Feihong. There is no sooner or later for the same return, but Yingshui has a clear source. Jun Si Ying water green, suddenly return to Song Cen. Don't wash your ears when you return, wash your heart for me. Wash your heart to get true feelings, wash your ears to buy fame. Xie Gong finally stayed together to help the common people."
浪漫,李白,同王昌龄送族弟襄归桂阳二首,唐,秦地见碧草，楚谣对清樽。把酒尔何思，鹧鸪啼南园。余欲罗浮隐，犹怀明主恩。踌躇紫宫恋，孤负沧洲言。终然无心云，海上同飞翻。相期乃不浅，幽桂有芳根。尔家何在潇湘川，青莎白石长沙边。昨梦江花照江日，几枝正发东窗前。觉来欲往心悠然，魂随越鸟飞南天。秦云连山海相接，桂水横烟不可涉。送君此去令人愁，风帆茫茫隔河洲。春潭琼草绿可折，西寄长安明月楼。,Romantic,Li Bai,Two Poems with Wang Changling Sending His Clan Brother Back to Guiyang,"Qindi sees green grass, and Chu Yao meets Qingzun. How can you think about the wine, and the partridge crows in the South Garden. I want Luo Fuyin, but I still cherish the grace of the Lord Ming. Hesitating about purple palace love, disappointing Cangzhouyan. In the end, there is no heart, and the sea flies together. The phase period is not shallow, and the osmanthus has fragrant roots. Where is your family in Xiaoxiangchuan, beside the green sand and white stone Changsha. Yesterday I dreamed that the river flowers were shining on the river day, and a few branches were blooming in front of the east window. Feeling the desire to go, the heart is leisurely, and the soul flies to the south with the bird. Qin Yun is connected with mountains and seas, and the water of Guishui is untouchable. Sending you off here is worrying, and the sails are vast across the river continent. Chuntan Qiongcao green can be folded, and sent west to Chang'an Mingyue Tower."
浪漫,李白,东鲁门泛舟二首,唐,日落沙明天倒开，波摇石动水萦回。轻舟泛月寻溪转，疑是山隐雪后来。水作青龙盘石堤，桃花夹岸鲁门西。若教月下乘舟去，何啻风流到剡溪。,Romantic,Li Bai,Two Poems of Rafting in Donglumen,"The sunset sand will fall tomorrow, and the rocks will shake and the water will linger. Floating in a light boat on the moon to find the stream, it is suspected that the snow is hidden in the mountains. The water is used as Qinglong Panshi embankment, and the peach blossoms are interspersed with Lumen West. If you teach me to go by boat under the moon, He Chi will wind up to Shanxi."
浪漫,李白,游泰山六首,唐,四月上泰山，石屏御道开。六龙过万壑，涧谷随萦回。马迹绕碧峰，于今满青苔。飞流洒绝巘，水急松声哀。北眺崿嶂奇，倾崖向东摧。洞门闭石扇，地底兴云雷。登高望蓬瀛，想象金银台。天门一长啸，万里清风来。玉女四五人，飘飖下九垓。含笑引素手，遗我流霞杯。稽首再拜之，自愧非仙才。旷然小宇宙，弃世何悠哉。清晓骑白鹿，直上天门山。山际逢羽人，方瞳好容颜。扪萝欲就语，却掩青云关。遗我鸟迹书，飘然落岩间。其字乃上古，读之了不闲。感此三叹息，从师方未还。平明登日观，举手开云关。精神四飞扬，如出天地间。黄河从西来，窈窕入远山。凭崖揽八极，目尽长空闲。偶然值青童，绿发双云鬟。笑我晚学仙，蹉跎凋朱颜。踌躇忽不见，浩荡难追攀。清斋三千日，裂素写道经。吟诵有所得，众神卫我形。云行信长风，飒若羽翼生。攀崖上日观，伏槛窥东溟。海色动远山，天鸡已先鸣。银台出倒景，白浪翻长鲸。安得不死药，高飞向蓬瀛。日观东北倾，两崖夹双石。海水落眼前，天光遥空碧。千峰争攒聚，万壑绝凌历。缅彼鹤上仙，去无云中迹。长松入云汉，远望不盈尺。山花异人间，五月雪中白。终当遇安期，于此鍊玉液。朝饮王母池，暝投天门关。独抱绿绮琴，夜行青山间。山明月露白，夜静松风歇。仙人游碧峰，处处笙歌发。寂静娱清晖，玉真连翠微。想象鸾凤舞，飘飖龙虎衣。扪天摘匏瓜，恍惚不忆归。举手弄清浅，误攀织女机。明晨坐相失，但见五云飞。,Romantic,Li Bai,Six Poems of Traveling to Mount Tai,"In April, when I went to Mount Tai, the Shiping Royal Road opened. Six dragons pass through myriad ravines, and ravines and valleys linger back and forth. The trail of horses circles Bifeng, which is now covered with moss. Flying and shedding, the water is rushing and loosening. Looking to the north, you can see the strange peaks and cliffs, and the cliffs are destroyed to the east. The gate of the cave is closed with a stone fan, and the ground is filled with clouds and thunder. Climbing high to look at Pengying, imagining Jinyintai. With a long roar at the gate of heaven, a cool breeze comes from thousands of miles. Four or five jade girls floated down to Jiugai. With a smile, I lead Su's hand, and I leave my Liuxia cup. Jishou worships him again, ashamed of being a fairy. In the open and small universe, how carefree is it to abandon the world. Qingxiao rode a white deer straight up Tianmen Mountain. There is a feathered man in the mountains, and Fang Tong has a good face. Menluo wants to speak, but hides Qingyunguan. I left my book on the bird's trace, and fell into the rocks. Its characters are ancient, and it is not idle to read them. Feeling these three sighs, I have not returned from my teacher. Climb to the sun in Pingming, raise your hand to open the cloud gate. The spirit is flying in all directions, like going out of heaven and earth. The Yellow River comes from the west and flows into the distant mountains. Relying on the cliff to grasp the eight poles, the eyes are free for as long as possible. Occasionally, he is a young boy with green hair and double clouds. Laughing at me learning to be a fairy late, I wasted my beautiful face. Hesitating and suddenly disappearing, the mighty is hard to catch up. During the three thousand days of Qingzhai, Li Su wrote the scriptures. There is income from reciting, and the gods guard me. Clouds travel and believe in the wind, rustling like wings. Climb the cliff to watch the sun, and look down on the threshold to see Dongming. The color of the sea moves the distant mountains, and the rooster crows first. The Yintai looks down, and the white waves turn over the long whale. Take the elixir and fly high to Pengying. Riguan leans northeast, with two cliffs and two stones. The sea water falls in front of my eyes, and the sky is far away and blue. Thousands of peaks compete to gather, and thousands of ravines are beyond the calendar. Myanbi Crane went to the Immortal, and went to the cloudless middle. The long pine enters Yunhan, and the distance is not full. The mountain flowers are different from the world, and the snow is white in May. Finally, when you meet the safe period, here is the chain of jade liquid. Drink the Queen Mother Pool in the morning, and throw yourself into the Tianmen Pass in the dark. Holding the green Qiqin alone, walking among the green mountains at night. The mountain is bright and the moon is dew white, and the night is quiet and the wind is resting. Immortals travel to Bifeng, singing and singing everywhere. Silence entertains Qinghui, Yuzhen connects Cuiwei. Imagine the dance of the phoenix and the dance of the dragon and the tiger. I went to the sky to pick paw melons, but I was in a trance without remembering to return. Raise your hand to find out the light, and climb the weaving machine by mistake. Tomorrow morning sitting phase lost, but see five clouds flying."
浪漫,李白,游秋浦白笴陂二首,唐,何处夜行好，月明白笴陂。山光摇积雪，猿影挂寒枝。但恐佳景晚，小令归棹移。人来有清兴，及此有相思。白笴夜长啸，爽然溪谷寒。鱼龙动陂水，处处生波澜。天借一明月，飞来碧云端。故乡不可见，肠断正西看。,Romantic,Li Bai,Two Poems by You Qiupu and Baijianpi,"Where is the best place to travel at night, and the moon is bright. The mountain light shakes the snow, and the ape shadow hangs on the cold branches. But fearing that the good times will be late, Xiaoling will return to Zhaoyi. People come to have Qingxing, and this has lovesickness. The night of the white night screams, and the valley is cold. Fish and dragons move the water, creating waves everywhere. The sky borrows a bright moon and flies to the blue clouds. The hometown is not visible, and the heartbroken is looking westward."
浪漫,李白,月下独酌四首,唐,花间一壶酒，独酌无相亲。举杯邀明月，对影成三人。月既不解饮，影徒随我身。暂伴月将影，行乐须及春。我歌月裴回，我舞影零乱。醒时同交欢，醉后各分散。永结无情游，相期邈云汉。天若不爱酒，酒星不在天。地若不爱酒，地应无酒泉。天地既爱酒，爱酒不愧天。已闻清比圣，复道浊如贤。贤圣既已饮，何必求神仙。三杯通大道，一斗合自然。但得酒中趣，勿为醒者传。三月咸阳城，千花昼如锦。谁能春独愁，对此径须饮。穷通与修短，造化夙所禀。一樽齐死生，万事固难审。醉后失天地，兀然就孤枕。不知有吾身，此乐最为甚。穷愁千万端，美酒三百杯。愁多酒虽少，酒倾愁不来。所以知酒圣，酒酣心自开。辞粟卧首阳，屡空饥颜回。当代不乐饮，虚名安用哉。蟹螯即金液，糟丘是蓬莱。且须饮美酒，乘月醉高台。,Romantic,Li Bai,Four Poems of Drinking Alone under the Moon,"jug of wine among the flowers, drinking alone without a blind date. Raise your glass to invite the bright moon, and make three people face each other. The moon does not drink, and the shadow follows me.暂伴月将影，But still for a while I want to accompany the moon, 行乐须及春。 I should be to enjoy life in the spring. I sing Yue Peihui, and my dancing shadow is chaotic.醒时同交欢，Pursue pleasure when I am awake, 醉后各分散。 When drunken I reel, our companionship ends. Forever and ruthless travel, we will meet each other for a long time. If the sky does not love wine, the wine star is not in the sky. If the land does not love wine, the land should have no wine springs. Both heaven and earth love wine, and the love of wine is worthy of heaven. It has been heard that the Qing is more holy than the saint, and the Tao is as turbid as a sage. Since the sages have already drunk, why ask the gods. Three cups lead to the road, and one fight is natural. But if you have fun in wine, don't pass it on to the sober. In March Xianyang City, thousands of flowers and day like brocade. Who can worry about spring alone, he must drink for this. Poor communication and short-cutting are inherent in good fortune. A bottle of life and death, everything is hard to judge. After getting drunk, I lose the world, and suddenly I am alone. I don't know my body, this is the most joy. There are thousands of poverty and sorrow, and three hundred glasses of fine wine. There is a lot of sorrow, but there is little wine, but the wine does not come to worry. Therefore, the sage of wine knows that wine is heart-warming. Saying goodbye to millet and lying in Shouyang, repeatedly empty and hungry. If you don't enjoy drinking in the contemporary era, the false name is safe and useful. Crab claws are gold liquid, and bad mounds are Penglai. And you must drink fine wine and ride the moon to get drunk on the high platform."
浪漫,李白,过汪氏别业二首,唐,游山谁可游，子明与浮丘。叠岭碍河汉，连峰横斗牛。汪生面北阜，池馆清且幽。我来感意气，搥炰列珍羞。扫石待归月，开池涨寒流。酒酣益爽气，为乐不知秋。畴昔未识君，知君好贤才。随山起馆宇，凿石营池台。星火五月中，景风从南来。数枝石榴发，一丈荷花开。恨不当此时，相过醉金罍。我行值木落，月苦清猿哀。永夜达五更，吴歈送琼杯。酒酣欲起舞，四座歌相催。日出远海明，轩车且裴回。更游龙潭去，枕石拂莓苔。,Romantic,Li Bai,Guo Wang's Bieye Two Poems,"Who can swim in the mountains, Ziming and Fuqiu. Stacked mountains hinder the Milky Way, and even the peaks cross the bullfight. Wang Sheng faces Beifu, and the pool hall is clear and secluded. I'm here to feel angry and feel ashamed. Sweeping stones to wait for the moon, opening the pool to rise the cold current. The wine is intoxicating and refreshing, and I don't know autumn for joy. I didn't know you in the past, but I know you are good talents. Buildings followed the mountains, and stone camps and platforms were chiseled. In mid-May of Xinghuo, Jingfeng comes from the south. A few branches of pomegranates bloom, and a foot of lotus blooms. I hate that at this time, I have passed the drunken golden scorpion. My line is worth the wood falling, the moon is bitter and the ape mourns. Yongye reaches the fifth watch, and Wu Xie sends Qiong Cup. The wine is full of desire to dance, and the four songs urge each other. The sun rises and the sea is bright, and the car is ready to return. Go to Longtan more, pillow stone and brush berry moss."
浪漫,李白,春日独酌二首,唐,东风扇淑气，水木荣春晖。白日照绿草，落花散且飞。孤云还空山，众鸟各已归。彼物皆有托，吾生独无依。对此石上月，长醉歌芳菲。我有紫霞想，缅怀沧洲间。思对一壶酒，澹然万事闲。横琴倚高松，把酒望远山。长空去鸟没，落日孤云还。但恐光景晚，宿昔成秋颜。,Romantic,Li Bai,Drink Alone in Spring,"Dong Fan is Shuqi, Mizuki Rong Chunhui. The white sun shines on the green grass, and the falling flowers are scattered and flying. The lonely cloud is still empty on the mountain, and all the birds have returned. Everything is supported, and my life is alone without support. For this stone on the moon, I am drunk and sing Fangfei. I think of Zixia, remembering Cangzhou. Thinking about a pot of wine, everything is indifferent. The Hengqin leans against the tall pine, and the wine looks at the distant mountains. The sky is gone, the birds are gone, and the setting sun is still alone. But I am afraid that the situation will be late, and the past will become autumn."
浪漫,李白,效古二首,唐,朝入天苑中，谒帝蓬莱宫。青山映辇道，碧树摇苍空。谬题金闺籍，得与银台通。待诏奉明主，抽毫颂清风。归时落日晚，躞蹀浮云骢。人马本无意，飞驰自豪雄。入门紫鸳鸯，金井双梧桐。清歌弦古曲，美酒沽新丰。快意且为乐，列筵坐群公。光景不可留，生世如转蓬。早达胜晚遇，羞比垂钓翁。自古有秀色，西施与东邻。蛾眉不可妒，况乃效其颦。所以尹婕妤，羞见邢夫人。低头不出气，塞默少精神。寄语无盐子，如君何足珍。,Romantic,Li Bai,Two Songs of Xiaogu,"Entering the Tianyuan, visiting Emperor Penglai Palace. The green hills reflect the chariot road, and the green trees shake the sky. The absurd title of golden boudoir can be communicated with Yintai. Waiting for the edict to serve the Ming Lord, take a penny to sing the breeze. When I return home, the sunset is late, and the clouds are floating around. People and horses have no intention of galloping proudly. Getting started with purple mandarin ducks and Jinjing double sycamores. Qing songs are stringed with ancient songs, and fine wine is sold in Xinfeng. If you want to be happy, you will have a banquet with a group of people. The scene can't stay, life is like turning around. Early arrival wins late encounter, shame than fishing. It has been beautiful since ancient times, and Xishi is adjacent to the east. Crescent eyebrows should not be jealous, the situation is to imitate their frowns. So Yin Jieyu was ashamed to see Mrs. Xing. With his head down and no breath, Seymour is less energetic. Send a message without salt, as precious as you are."
浪漫,李白,拟古十二首,唐,青天何历历，明星如白石。黄姑与织女，相去不盈尺。银河无鹊桥，非时将安适。闺人理纨素，游子悲行役。瓶冰知冬寒，霜露欺远客。客似秋叶飞，飘飖不言归。别后罗带长，愁宽去时衣。乘月托宵梦，因之寄金徽。高楼入青天，下有白玉堂。明月看欲堕，当窗悬清光。遥夜一美人，罗衣沾秋霜。含情弄柔瑟，弹作陌上桑。弦声何激烈，风捲绕飞梁。行人皆踯躅，栖鸟起回翔。但写妾意苦，莫辞此曲伤。愿逢同心者，飞作紫鸳鸯。长绳难系日，自古共悲辛。黄金高北斗，不惜买阳春。石火无留光，还如世中人。即事已如梦，后来我谁身。提壶莫辞贫，取酒会四邻。仙人殊恍惚，未若醉中真。清都绿玉树，灼烁瑶台春。攀花弄秀色，远赠天仙人。香风送紫蕊，直到扶桑津。取掇世上艳，所贵心之珍。相思传一笑，聊欲示情亲。今日风日好，明日恐不如。春风笑于人，何乃愁自居。吹箫舞彩凤，酌醴鲙神鱼。千金买一醉，取乐不求馀。达士遗天地，东门有二疏。愚夫同瓦石，有才知卷舒。无事坐悲苦，块然涸辙鱼。运速天地闭，胡风结飞霜。百草死冬月，六龙颓西荒。太白出东方，彗星扬精光。鸳鸯非越鸟，何为眷南翔。惟昔鹰将犬，今为侯与王。得水成蛟龙，争池夺凤凰。北斗不酌酒，南箕空簸扬。世路今太行，回车竟何托。万族皆凋枯，遂无少可乐。旷野多白骨，幽魂共销铄。荣贵当及时，春华宜照灼。人非昆山玉，安得长璀错。身没期不朽，荣名在麟阁。月色不可扫，客愁不可道。玉露生秋衣，流萤飞百草。日月终销毁，天地同枯槁。蟪蛄啼青松，安见此树老。金丹宁误俗，昧者难精讨。尔非千岁翁，多恨去世早。饮酒入玉壶，藏身以为宝。生者为过客，死者为归人。天地一逆旅，同悲万古尘。月兔空捣药，扶桑已成薪。白骨寂无言，青松岂知春。前后更叹息，浮荣安足珍。仙人骑彩凤，昨下阆风岑。海水三清浅，桃源一见寻。遗我绿玉杯，兼之紫琼琴。杯以倾美酒，琴以闲素心。二物非世有，何论珠与金。琴弹松里风，杯劝天上月。风月长相知，世人何倏忽。涉江弄秋水，爱此荷花鲜。攀荷弄其珠，荡漾不成圆。佳人綵云里，欲赠隔远天。相思无由见，怅望凉风前。去去复去去，辞君还忆君。汉水既殊流，楚山亦此分。人生难称意，岂得长为群。越燕喜海日，燕鸿思朔云。别久容华晚，琅玕不能饭。日落知天昏，梦长觉道远。望夫登高山，化石竟不返。,Romantic,Li Bai,Twelve Imitation Ancient Poems,"How clear is the blue sky, and the stars are like white stones. Huang Gu and Zhinu are not far apart. There is no magpie bridge in the Milky Way, and there will be peace in time. The boudoir is in charge of money, and the wanderer is in mourning. Ping Bing knows the winter cold, and Frost Dew deceives distant guests. The guests fly like autumn leaves, but they don't say anything about returning. Farewell to the long belt behind the back, worry about the width and go to the time clothes. Take the moon to entrust the night dream, and send the golden emblem because of it. The tall building enters the blue sky, and there is a white jade hall below. The bright moon looks like it wants to fall, when the window hangs clear light. There is a beautiful woman in the remote night, and her clothes are covered with autumn frost. Play softly with affection, play as Moshang Sang. How fierce the sound of the strings is, the wind winds around the flying beams. Pedestrians are walking around, and the perching birds are flying back and forth. But writing a concubine is painful, don't say this song hurts. May those who meet the same heart fly as purple mandarin ducks. The long rope is difficult to tie the sun, and since ancient times there have been sorrows and sorrows. Gold high Beidou, do not hesitate to buy Yangchun. There is no light left on the stone and fire, and you are still like a person in the world. That is to say, things are like a dream, and who will I be later. Don't be poor when you carry a pot, and take a wine party with your neighbors. Immortals are in a trance, not as if they are drunk. The green jade trees in Qingdu shine brightly in Yaotai spring. Panhua makes beauty, far away as a gift to heaven and immortals. The fragrant wind sends Zirui until Fusangjin. Take the beauty in the world, the treasure of your heart. Lovesickness spreads a smile, and chats to show love. The weather is fine today, but it might not be as good tomorrow. The spring breeze smiles at others, but He Nai is worried about himself. Playing the flute and dancing the colorful phoenix, drinking sweet carp and god fish. A thousand pieces of gold buys a drunk, and there is nothing left for pleasure. Dashi left the world, and there are two sparse ones at the east gate. Fools are like tiles and stones, but those who are talented know how to roll. Sitting in misery with nothing to do, the block ran dry. The world is closed at a fast speed, and Hu Feng is frosted. Baicao dies in the winter moon, and six dragons decay in the western wilderness. Taibai came out of the east, and the comet shone brightly. Mandarin ducks are not Yue birds, so what is Nanxiang. But the eagles and dogs in the past are now the lords and kings. Get the water to become a dragon, fight for the pond to win the phoenix. The Big Dipper doesn't drink wine, and the Nanji is empty. The road of the world is too far away today, so what's the point of entering the car. All races are withered, so there is no less joy. There are many bones in the wilderness, and the ghosts are sold together. The glory should be timely, and the spring flowers should be shining. People are not Kunshan jade, and they are long and bright. The body is immortal, and the honor is in Lin Pavilion. The moonlight cannot be swept away, and the guest's worries cannot be explained. Jade dew gives birth to autumn clothes, and fireflies fly to the grass. The sun and the moon will eventually be destroyed, and the heaven and the earth will wither together. The cricket crows at the green pine, and I can see that the tree is old. Gold tannin misleads the vulgar, and it is difficult for those who are ignorant to discuss it carefully. I am not a thousand-year-old man, how I hate to die early. Drink wine into the jade pot, hide yourself as a treasure. The living are passers-by, and the dead are returnees. The heaven and the earth are traveling against each other, and they are in mourning for the eternal dust. The moon rabbit smashes medicine in the air, and Fusang has become a salary. The bones are silent and silent, but the green pines don't know spring. Sigh more before and after, Fu Rong An Zuzhen. The immortal rides the colorful phoenix, and went down to Langfeng Cen yesterday. The sea water is clear and shallow, and Taoyuan can be found at first sight. I left my green jade cup and Ziqiongqin. The cup is used to pour fine wine, and the piano is used to relax the heart. Two things do not exist in the world, how about pearls and gold. Play the qin in the wind in the pine, and the cup persuades the sky to go to the moon. The wind and the moon know each other, so why is the world so sudden. I love the fresh lotus flowers when I am involved in the autumn water in the river. Panhe plays with its pearls, and the waves cannot form a circle. The beautiful woman is in the colorful clouds, and she wants to give it to the distant sky. There is no reason to see lovesickness, and I look forward to the cool breeze. To go back and forth, to say goodbye to the king and to remember the king. The Han River flows differently, so does the Chu Mountain. Life is hard to please, how can we grow into a group. Yue Yan likes the sea day, Yan Hong thinks of Shuo Yun. Don't be too late for Ronghua, Langgan can't eat. The sunset knows the sky and the sky is dark, and the dream is long and the road is far away. Wangfu climbed the mountain, but the fossil did not return."
浪漫,李白,感兴六首,唐,瑶姬天帝女，精彩化朝云。宛转入宵梦，无心向楚君。锦衾抱秋月，绮席空兰芬。茫昧竟谁测，虚传宋玉文。洛浦有宓妃，飘飖雪争飞。轻云拂素月，了可见清辉。解佩欲西去，含情讵相违。香尘动罗袜，绿水不沾衣。陈王徒作赋，神女岂同归。好色伤大雅，多为世所讥。裂素持作书，将寄万里怀。眷眷待远信，竟岁无人来。征鸿务随阳，又不为我栖。委之在深箧，蠹鱼坏其题。何如投水中，流落他人开。不惜他人开，但恐生是非。十五游神仙，仙游未曾歇。吹笙坐松风，汎瑟窥海月。西山玉童子，使我鍊金骨。欲逐黄鹤飞，相呼向蓬阙。西国有美女，结楼青云端。蛾眉艳晓月，一笑倾城欢。高节不可夺，炯心如凝丹。常恐彩色晚，不为人所观。安得配君子，共乘双飞鸾。嘉谷隐丰草，草深苗且稀。农夫既不异，孤穗将安归。常恐委畴陇，忽与秋蓬飞。乌得荐宗庙，为君生光辉。,Romantic,Li Bai,Feeling six,"Yao Ji, the daughter of the Heavenly Emperor, is wonderfully transformed into Chaoyun. Wanzhuan into Xiaomeng, unintentionally to Chu Jun. The brocade quilt embraces the autumn moon, and the beautiful seats are empty. Who can predict the confusion, and falsely spread Song Yuwen. There is Concubine Mi in Luopu, and the fluttering snow competes with each other. The light cloud blows the plain moon, and the brilliance can be seen. Xie Pei wanted to go west, but he was in love with each other. The fragrant dust moves the socks, and the green water does not stick to the clothes. Chen Wang only writes Fu, how can the goddess return to the same place? Being lustful hurts elegance, and is often ridiculed by the world. Li Su holds a book and will send it thousands of miles away. The relatives waited for Yuanxin, but no one came. Zhenghong works with the sun, but does not live for me. If you entrust it in a deep box, silverfish will ruin its title. How about throwing yourself into the water and drifting away from others. He doesn't hesitate to be opened by others, but he is afraid of right and wrong. Fifteen travels to the gods, and the journey of the immortals never stops. Blowing the sheng and sitting on the pine wind, looking at the moon in the sea. Xishan Jade Boy made me a golden bone. If you want to chase the yellow cranes, you will call to Peng Que. There are beauties in the West Country, and they are as green as clouds. The eyebrows are bright and the moon is bright, and the city is full of joy with a smile. The high festival is invincible, and the heart is like a condensed pill. I am often afraid that the color will be late, and I will not be seen by others. Ande is matched with a gentleman, and rides a pair of flying phoenixes together. Jiagu Yinfeng grass, grass deep seedlings and thin. The farmer is the same, and the lone ear will return safely. I am often afraid of appointing Choulong, and suddenly flying with Qiu Peng. Wude recommends the ancestral temple, which is glorious for the king."

King Wu didn't hesitate in the past, he cut his claws and threw himself into the river. When a sage encounters slander, it is inevitable that people will be suspicious. The wind pulls out the big trees, and the millet is salty and wilted. Guan Cai fans the flies, and the public writes owl poems. If the golden scorpion is not opened, who will be loyal and trustworthy will know it. There are two colorful phoenixes, and three green birds. Going back to Yaotai, singing and dancing Yushan Cen.

浪漫,李白,寄远十一首,唐,三鸟别王母，衔书来见过。肠断若剪弦，其如愁思何。遥知玉窗里，纤手弄云和。奏曲有深意，青松交女萝。写水山井中，同泉岂殊波。秦心与楚恨，皎皎为谁多。青楼何所在，乃在碧云中。宝镜挂秋水，罗衣轻春风。新妆坐落日，怅望金屏空。念此送短书，愿因双飞鸿。本作一行书，殷勤道相忆。一行复一行，满纸情何极。瑶台有黄鹤，为报青楼人。朱颜凋落尽，白发一何新。自知未应还，离居经三春。桃李今若为，当窗发光彩。莫使香风飘，留与红芳待。玉箸落春镜，坐愁湖阳水。闻与阴丽华，风烟接邻里。青春已复过，白日忽相催。但恐荷花晚，令人意已摧。相思不惜梦，日夜向阳台。远忆巫山阳，花明渌江暖。踌躇未得往，泪向南云满。春风复无情，吹我梦魂断。不见眼中人，天长音信短。阳台隔楚水，春草生黄河。相思无日夜，浩荡若流波。流波向海去，欲见终无因。遥将一点泪，远寄如花人。妾在舂陵东，君居汉江岛。一日望花光，往来成白道。一为云雨别，此地生秋草。秋草秋蛾飞，相思愁落晖。何由一相见，灭烛解罗衣。忆昨东园桃李红碧枝，与君此时初别离。金瓶落井无消息，令人行叹复坐思。坐思行叹成楚越，春风玉颜畏销歇。碧窗纷纷下落花，青楼寂寂空明月。两不见，但相思，空留锦字表心素，至今缄愁不忍窥。长短春草绿，缘阶如有情。卷施心独苦，抽却死还生。睹物知妾意，希君种后庭。闲时当采掇，念此莫相轻。鲁缟如玉霜，笔题月氏书。寄书白鹦鹉，西海慰离居。行数虽不多，字字有委曲。天末如见之，开缄泪相续。泪尽恨转深，千里同此心。相思千万里，一书值千金。爱君芙蓉婵娟之艳色，色可餐兮难再得。怜君冰玉清迥之明心，情不极兮意已深。朝共琅玕之绮食，夜同鸳鸯之锦衾。恩情婉娈忽为别，使人莫错乱愁心。乱愁心，涕如雪，寒灯厌梦魂欲绝。觉来相思生白发，盈盈汉水若可越。可惜凌波步罗袜，美人美人兮归去来，莫作朝云暮雨兮飞阳台。,Romantic,Li Bai,send away eleven,"Three birds farewell to the queen mother, I have come to see you with a book. A broken heart is like cutting a string, it is like worrying about what to think. I know from a distance that in the jade window, I can make clouds with my hands. The sonata has a deep meaning, and the green pine makes a girl. When writing about water in mountains and wells, the same spring is different. Qin Xin and Chu hate, who is more Jiaojiao. Where is the brothel? It's in the green clouds. The precious mirror hangs autumn water, and Luo Yi lightens the spring breeze. The new makeup is located on the day, looking at the golden screen empty. Read this to send a short book, and I hope to be a double Feihong. This is a one-line script, which is courteous and recalls each other. Line after line, the paper is full of love. There is a yellow crane in Yaotai, who is from the brothel. The red face is withered, and the white hair is new. Knowing that I should not return it, I have lived away for three springs. If peaches and plums are here now, they will shine brightly when the window. Don't let the fragrance float in the wind, stay with Hongfang. The jade chopsticks fall into the spring mirror, sitting in worry about the Yangshui of the lake. Wen and Yin Lihua, the wind and smoke meet the neighbors. Youth has returned, and the day suddenly reminds me. But fearing that the lotus will be too late, it will destroy people's minds. Acacia does not hesitate to dream, day and night to the balcony. Recalling Wu Shanyang from afar, the flowers are bright and the river is warm. Hesitating but not going, tears are full of tears to Nanyun. The spring breeze is merciless again, blowing my dreams to pieces. If you don't see the person in your eyes, the sky is long and the message is short. The balcony is separated from the Chu River, and the spring grass grows the Yellow River. Acacia has no day and night, mighty like flowing waves. The waves go to the sea, and there is no reason for wanting to see. Send a little tear from afar to someone like a flower. The concubine is in the east of Chongling, and the king lives on Hanjiang Island. Looking at the flowers in a day, the traffic becomes white. One is the cloud and rain, autumn grass grows here. Autumn grass and autumn moths fly, lovesickness and sorrow fall. Why meet each other, put out the candle and untie the clothes. Recalling the peaches, plums, red and bizhis in the East Garden yesterday, I parted from you for the first time at this time. There is no news of the gold bottle falling into the well, which makes people sigh and think again. Sitting thinking and sighing into Chuyue, the spring breeze and beautiful face are afraid of being sold out. Flowers are falling on the blue windows, and the brothel is silent and empty with a bright moon. I don't see each other, but I miss each other, leaving the brocade word in the air to express my heart, and I still can't bear to peep at it. The long and short spring grass is green, and the margins are like love. Juan Shi's heart is lonely and bitter, but he survived the death. Seeing things to know my concubine's intentions, I hope you will plant a backyard. When you are free, you should pick it up, and think about it. Lu Yu is like jade frost, and the pen is inscribed on Yuezhi's book. Send a book to the white parrot, Xihai comforts and leaves. Although the number of lines is not many, every word has twists and turns. At the end of the day, if you see it, you will continue to cry. Tears and hatred turn deep, thousands of miles with the same heart. Lovesickness is thousands of miles away, and a book is worth a thousand gold. The beauty of Aijun Furong and Chanjuan is so delicious that it is hard to find again. Lianjun Bingyu's clear heart, the love is not extreme, and the meaning is already deep. In the morning, we share the delicious food of Langgan, and at night we share the brocade quilt of mandarin ducks. The kindness is gentle and sudden, so that people don't get confused and worried. Disorderly worry, tears like snow, cold lamp tired of dreams. I feel that lovesickness gives birth to white hair, and the Yingying Han River can be crossed. It's a pity that Lingbo wears socks, beautiful women and beautiful women come back, don't fly to the balcony in the morning clouds and evening rain."
浪漫,李白,代美人愁镜二首,唐,明明金鹊镜，了了玉台前。拂拭交冰月，光辉何清圆。红颜老昨日，白发多去年。铅粉坐相误，照来空凄然。美人赠此盘龙之宝镜，烛我金缕之罗衣。时将红袖拂明月，为惜普照之馀晖。影中金鹊飞不灭，台下青鸾思独绝。藁砧一别若箭弦，去有日，来无年。狂风吹却妾心断，玉箸并堕菱花前。,Romantic,Li Bai,Two Songs of Worrying Mirror on behalf of the Beauty,"It is clear that the golden magpie mirror is in front of the jade platform. Wipe away the icy moon, the brilliance is so clear and round. The beauty is old yesterday, and the gray hair is more than last year. The lead powder sits on the wrong side, and the photo comes empty and desolate. The beauty gave me this precious mirror of the coiling dragon, and candled my robe of golden thread. At that time, the red sleeves are brushed against the bright moon, to cherish the afterglow of the universal light. In the shadow, the golden magpie is immortal, while the green luan in the audience thinks of being alone. A high anvil is like an arrow string, there will be days when you go, but there will be no years when you come. The strong wind blows but the concubine's heart is broken, and the jade chopsticks fall in front of the water chestnut."
浪漫,李白,送内寻庐山女道士李腾空二首,唐,君寻腾空子，应到碧山家。水舂云母碓，风埽石楠花。若爱幽居好，相邀弄紫霞。多君相门女，学道爱神仙。素手掬青霭，罗衣曳紫烟。一往屏风叠，乘鸾着玉鞭。,Romantic,Li Bai,"Sending two poems by Li Tengkong, a female Taoist priest of Lushan Mountain","Jun Xun took a break and should go to Bishan's house. The water is pounding the mica pestle, and the wind is pounding heather. If you love to live in seclusion, invite you to make Zixia. Many monarchs and daughters, learn Taoism and love gods. The plain hands hold the green mist, and Luo Yi drags the purple smoke. Fold to the screen, ride a luan with a jade whip."
浪漫,李白,出妓金陵子呈卢六四首,唐,安石东山三十春，傲然携妓出风尘。楼中见我金陵子，何似阳台云雨人。南国新丰酒，东山小妓歌。对君君不乐，花月奈愁何。东道烟霞主，西江诗酒筵。相逢不觉醉，日堕历阳川。小妓金陵歌楚声，家僮丹砂学凤鸣。我亦为君饮清酒，君心不肯向人倾。,Romantic,Li Bai,"Sixty-Four Poems of Jinling Zi Chenglu, a Prostitute","In the thirtieth spring of Dongshan, Anshi proudly brought prostitutes out of the world. Seeing me in the building, Jinlingzi, I look like a cloud and rain on the balcony. Xinfeng wine in the southern country, and the little prostitute song in Dongshan. If you are not happy with Junjun, Hua Yuenai is worried. The master of haze in the east, the banquet of poems and wine in Xijiang. If you don't feel drunk when you meet, you will fall into Liyangchuan every day. The little prostitute sings in Jinling and sings the sound of Chu, and the family boy Dansha imitates Fengming. I also drink sake for you, and your heart refuses to pour out to others."
浪漫,李白,上清宝鼎诗,唐,我居清空表，君处红埃中。仙人持玉尺，废君多少才。玉尺不可尽，君才无时休。咽服十二环，奄有仙人房。暮骑紫麟去，海气侵肌凉。赠我累累珠，靡靡明月光。,Romantic,Li Bai,Shangqing Baoding Poetry,"I live in the empty watch, and you are in the red dust. Immortals hold jade rulers, how talented are waste kings. The jade ruler is inexhaustible, and the gentleman has no time to rest. Swallow the twelve rings, and there is a fairy room in the dying. Riding Zilin at dusk, the sea air invades the muscles and cools down. Give me many pearls, the moonlight is extravagant."
浪漫,李白,上清宝鼎诗二首（附存）,唐,朝披梦泽云，笠钓青茫茫。寻丝得双鲤，中有三元章。篆字若丹蛇，逸势如飞翔。归来问天老，奥义不可量。金刀割青素，灵文烂煌煌。咽服十二环，奄见仙人房。暮跨紫鳞去，海气侵肌凉。龙子善变化，化作梅花妆。赠我累累珠，靡靡明月光。劝我穿绛缕，系作裙间裆。挹子以携去，谈笑闻遗香。人生烛上花，光灭巧妍尽。春风绕树头，日与化工进。只知雨露贪，不闻零落尽。我昔飞骨时，惨见当涂坟。青松霭朝霞，缥缈山丁村。既死明月魄，无复玻璃魂。念此一脱洒，长啸祭昆崙。醉著鸾皇衣，星斗俯可扪。,Romantic,Li Bai,Two Baoding Poems of the Shangqing Dynasty (attached),"Wearing dreams and clouds in the morning, fishing with bamboo hats is boundless. If you search for silk, you will get a double carp, and there is a three-yuan chapter in it. The seal character is like a snake, and its momentum is like flying. Come back and ask the old man, the meaning is immeasurable. The golden knife cuts the green element, and the spiritual writing is brilliant. Swallow the twelve rings and see the immortal room. Go across the purple scales at dusk, the sea air invades the muscles and cools. Long Zi is good at changing and turns into plum blossom makeup. Give me many pearls, the moonlight is extravagant. Advise me to wear crimson thread and tie it as the crotch of the skirt. Take the son with you, talk and laugh and smell the fragrance. Life is full of candles and flowers, and the light is gone, and the beauty is gone. The spring breeze winds around the tree head, and the sun and the chemical industry advance. I only know that the rain and dew are greedy, but I don't smell it. When I was flying bones in the past, I saw dangtu graves. Green pines and hazy morning glow, misty Shanding village. The soul of the moon is dead, and the soul of glass is gone. Read this free and easy, and make a long cry to sacrifice to Kunlun. Drunk in Luan's emperor's clothes, the stars are palpable."
浪漫,李白,桂殿秋,唐,仙女下，董双成，汉殿夜凉吹玉笙。曲终却从仙官去，万户千门惟月明。河汉女，玉鍊颜，云軿往往在人间。九霄有路去无迹，袅袅香风生佩环。,Romantic,Li Bai,Gui Dianqiu,"Under the Fairy, Dong Shuangcheng blows the Yusheng in the cold night of the Han Palace. At the end of the song, he went from the fairy official, and the moonlight was the only light in thousands of households. The girl of He Han, the jade chain face, the cloud is often in the world. Jiuxiao has a way to go without a trace, and the fragrance is fragrant and the ring is born."
浪漫,李白,清平乐,唐,禁庭春昼，莺羽披新绣。百草巧求花下斗，祗赌珠玑满斗。日晚却理残妆，御前闲舞霓裳。谁道腰肢窈窕，折旋笑得君王。禁闱秋夜，月探金窗罅。玉帐鸳鸯喷兰麝，时落银灯香灺。女伴莫话孤眠，六宫罗绮三千。一笑皆生百媚，宸衷教在谁边。烟深水阔，音信无由达。惟有碧天云外月，偏照悬悬离别。尽日感事伤怀，愁眉似锁难开。夜夜长留半被，待君魂梦归来。鸾衾凤褥，夜夜常孤宿。更被银台红蜡烛，学妾泪珠相续。花貌些子时光，抛人远泛潇湘。欹枕悔听寒漏，声声滴断愁肠。画堂晨起，来报雪花坠。高卷帘栊看佳瑞，皓色远迷庭砌。盛气光引炉烟，素草寒生玉佩。应是天仙狂醉，乱把白云揉碎。,Romantic,Li Bai,Qing Ping Le,"In the spring day of the forbidden court, Ying Yu wears new embroidery. Baicao cleverly asks for flowers to fight, but only bets on the full bucket of pearls. In the evenings, the remaining make-up is cleaned up, and the neon clothes are danced in front of the imperial court. Who knows that the waist and limbs are slender, and the king laughs like a king. In the forbidden autumn night, the moon explores the golden window. The mandarin ducks spray the orchid musk deer in the jade tent, and the silver lamps are fragrant from time to time. Don't talk about lonely sleep for the female companion, and three thousand Luo Qi in the sixth palace. Every smile is full of charm, who is Chen Zhong teaching on? The smoke is deep and the water is wide, and there is no way to get news. Only the blue sky, clouds and the moon, partly illuminate the parting. Feeling sad all day long, frowning like a lock is difficult to open. Stay half-quilted every night, waiting for Jun Hunmeng to return. Luan quilt and phoenix mattress, often stay alone every night. Even the red candles on the silver table, the tears of the school concubine continued. The flowers look like a little time, and people are far away from Xiaoxiang. The pillow regrets listening to the cold leak, and the sound of dripping breaks the heart of sorrow. Wake up in the painting hall in the morning and come to report the snowfall. Looking at Jiarui from the high rolling shutter, the bright color is far away from the courtyard. The light of the air draws the smoke from the furnace, and the jade pendant grows in the cold plain grass. It should be that the immortals were madly drunk and smashed the white clouds."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 清平调,唐,云想衣裳花想容，春风拂槛露华浓。若非群玉山头见，会向瑶台月下逢。一枝红艳露凝香，云雨巫山枉断肠。借问汉宫谁得似，可怜飞燕倚新妆。名花倾国两相欢，长得君王带笑看。解释春风无限恨，沈香亭北倚阑干。,Romantic,Li Bai,Miscellaneous lyrics Qingping tune,"Clouds think about clothes and flowers, and spring breeze blows Revlon. If it wasn't for Qunyu Mountain, I would meet Yaotai under the moon. A branch of red dew condenses the fragrance, cloud and rain Wushan heartbroken in vain. May I ask who is like the Han Palace, poor Feiyan Yi Xinzhuang. Famous and beautiful flowers are in love with each other, and they look like a king with a smile. Explain that the spring breeze has infinite hatred, and the Chenxiang Pavilion leans against the rails to the north."
浪漫,李白,塞下曲六首,唐,五月天山雪，无花祗有寒。笛中闻折柳，春色未曾看。晓战随金鼓，宵眠抱玉鞍。愿将腰下剑，直为斩楼兰。骏马似风飙，鸣鞭出渭桥。弯弓辞汉月，插羽破天骄。阵解星芒尽，营空海雾消。功成画麟阁，独有霍嫖姚。塞虏乘秋下，天兵出汉家。将军分虎竹，战士卧龙沙。边月随弓影，胡霜拂剑花。玉关殊未入，少妇莫长嗟。烽火动沙漠，连照甘泉云。汉皇按剑起，还召李将军。兵气天上合，鼓声陇底闻。横行负勇气，一战净妖氛。天兵下北荒，胡马欲南饮。横戈从百战，直为衔恩甚。握雪海上餐，拂沙陇头寝。何当破月氏，然后方高枕。白马黄金塞，云砂绕梦思。那堪愁苦节，远忆边城儿。萤飞秋窗满，月度霜闺迟。摧残梧桐叶，萧飒沙棠枝。无时独不见，流泪空自知。,Romantic,Li Bai,Plug the next six songs,"In May, there is snow in the Tianshan Mountains, there are no flowers, only cold. The willows are heard in the flute, but the spring scenery has never been seen. Xiaozhan follows the golden drum, night sleeps holding the jade saddle. I would like to put the sword down from the waist and cut Loulan straight. The horses are like the wind, whipping out of the Weiqiao. Bend the bow and bid farewell to the moon in Han Dynasty, and insert the feathers to break the arrogance of heaven. When the starlight is exhausted, the camp is empty and the sea fog disappears. Successfully painted Lin Pavilion, unique to Huo whoring Yao. The captives took advantage of the autumn, and the heavenly soldiers left the Han family. The general divides the tiger and the bamboo, and the warrior crouches in the sand. Bian Yue followed the shadow of the bow, and Hu Shuang brushed the sword flower. Yuguan has not yet entered, and young women should not sigh. The beacon fire moves the desert, and even shines on the sweet spring clouds. The Emperor of Han raised his sword and summoned General Li. The air of the soldiers is united in the sky, and the sound of drums can be heard at the bottom. Run rampant and lose courage, fight to clear the demon atmosphere. The heavenly soldiers went down to the northern wasteland, and Hu Ma wanted to drink in the south. Hengge has been fighting for a long time, and he has been very kind. Hold the snow on the sea to eat, and blow the sand to sleep on the Longtou. He Dang broke the Yueshi, and then he sat back. The white horse is stuffed with gold, and the clouds and sand surround dreams. It's a sad festival, recalling the border towns from afar. The firefly flies and the autumn window is full, and the moon is frosty and the boudoir is late. Destroy the sycamore leaves, Xiao Sa Sha Tang branches. There is no time to see alone, and tears are empty to know."

Where did this ancient immortal become immortal? Floating speed flowing current, suddenly changing brilliance. The world does not change, but the appearance changes. If you refuse to drink wine, whoever treats you if you have lust. Advise the king not to refuse the cup, the spring breeze laughs at people. Peaches and plums are like old acquaintances, and they bloom to me. Flowing warbler sings green tree, and the bright moon peeps golden scorpion. Zhu Yanzi came to Zhu Yanzi yesterday, and today he has white hair to remind him. The thorns live in the Stone Tiger Palace, and the deer walks away from the Gusu Terrace. Since ancient times, the emperor's residence has been closed to Huangai. If you don't drink alcohol, the ancients will be safe."
浪漫,李白,相和歌辞 王昭君二首,唐,昭君拂玉鞍，上马啼红颊。今日汉宫人，明朝胡地妾。汉家秦地月，流影照明妃。一上玉关道，天涯去不归。汉月还从东海出，明妃西嫁无来日。燕支长寒雪作花，蛾眉憔悴没胡沙。生乏黄金枉图画，死留青冢使人嗟。,Romantic,Li Bai,Xianghe Geci Wang Zhaojun Two Poems,"Zhaojun brushes the jade saddle, gets on the horse and crows with red cheeks. A native of the Han Palace today, a concubine of Hu Di in the Ming Dynasty. Qin Diyue of the Han family, concubine of Liuying Lighting. As soon as you go up the Yuguan road, you will never return to the end of the world. The moon of Han is still out from the East China Sea, and the Ming concubine will marry west and have no future. The swallows grow cold and the snow makes flowers, and the moth eyebrows are haggard and there is no sand. Life lacks gold and pictures are in vain, and death leaves green graves to make people sigh."

He shot and killed General Huyan from the battalion, and led the remnant soldiers back with thousands of horses. Join the Yumen Road in the army and drive away Jin Weishan. The flute plays plum blossom music, and the knife opens the moon ring. The sound of drums rang out over the sea, and the soldiers were engulfed in the clouds. I would like to kill Shan Yu at the head and drive Jingtieguan for a long time."

Whose family is beautiful, the cloud and the car are opened. The golden whip pointed at a distance, but Yule came back late. Asking each other with the hub, doubts come from the sky. Feeling sad and sad, the slanting sun reminds each other again. How light it is to get off the car, floating like a falling plum. Invite into the Qingqi Gate, share the cup as a song. Holding a cup to reflect the singing fan, it seems to be seen in the moon clouds. It is better not to meet each other than to meet each other. The love of meeting has been deep, and the heart can be known without words. Hu Wei guards the empty boudoir, sleeping alone and worrying about the brocade quilt. Brocade quilts and curtains are sometimes lingering. The spring breeze is swaying, how late is the evening rain? I hope that because of the three blue birds, I will repay my lovesickness. The situation does not wait for people, and it will become silk in a moment. When I lost my joy, I was only sad when I was old. Holding this secret meaning, there is no time for good times. When you meet in the world of mortals, you bow to the golden whip. Wanhu Chuiyangli, over there to Jun's house."

The male nests in the Han palace tree, and the female plays Qin Caofang. Ning Tongwan died to shatter the wings, and couldn't bear to split the clouds. At this time Gillian is jealous, sitting alone on the Nagato, worrying about the sunset. I hope that the king's kindness and concubines are deep, and he would not hesitate to buy poems with gold. Xiangru is gifted with gold, and her husband is so new and different. In one dynasty, a woman from Maoling will be hired, and Wenjun will give her a white-headed chant because of it. The east flow does not make the west return to the water, and the falling flowers and rhetoric return to the old forest. Rabbit silk is ruthless and can be turned upside down with the wind. Who's maid, Luo Zhi, came to hug her. Two grasses are still of one mind, but people's hearts are not as good as grass. Don't roll the dragon's beard mat, and make mesh from him. And leave the amber pillow, or when a dream comes. How can I fill the cup if it is covered with water? The abandoned concubine is gone and it is difficult to return. In ancient times, the pride has not been negative, but now we can only see the Qingling Terrace. Jinshui flows green in the east, and there are two mandarin ducks in waves. The male nests in the Han palace tree, and the female plays Qin Caofang. Xiangru went to Shu to pay homage to Emperor Wu, and the red chariot and four horses shone brightly. Once I look at the works of adults again, Wan Cheng suddenly wants to soar in the clouds. Hearing that Gillian fell out of favor, she bought a gift from the king with a thousand pieces of gold. Xiangru doesn't remember the poor and humble days, when officials, high-ranking and gold officials often hired private houses. All the Shuzi in Maoling saw and begged, and Wen Jun's love ended from then on. Tears are like double springs, falling into purple lapels. The chicken sings three times five times, and the white head sings in the morning. Long call out green cloud temples, look up to the blue sky and complain deeply. The wife of Qiliang in the collapse of the city has no heart. Flowing east does not make water returning to the west, falling flowers and branches make the old forest ashamed. The jade swallow hairpin on the head is a concubine's wedding gift. Give you a watch for lovesickness, and your sleeves will be brushed when you are lucky. Don't roll the dragon's beard mat, and make mesh from him. And keep the amber pillow, and when dreams come. The fur is on the Jinping, and there is no reason to wear it when you hang it. The concubine has Qin Loujing, who shines on the heart better than the well. May the newcomer who holds the photo be a pity for the couple. Covered with water but not enough to collect the cup, Xiangru also thanked Wenjun for returning. In ancient times, pride has not been negative, but now there is only Qinglingtai."

If the moonlight wants to go to the Nagato Hall, don't worry about the deep palace. The palace of osmanthus is full of sorrows and does not remember the spring, and the four houses of gold are full of autumn dust. A bright mirror hangs in the blue sky at night, shining alone on the people in Nagato Palace."
浪漫,李白,舞曲歌辞 白纻辞三首 其二,唐,月寒江清夜沈沈，美人一笑千黄金。垂罗舞縠扬哀音，郢中白雪且莫吟，子夜吴歌动君心。动君心，冀君赏。愿作天池双鸳鸯，一朝飞去青云上。吴刀剪綵缝舞衣，明妆丽服夺春辉。扬眉转袖若雪飞，倾城独立世所稀。激楚结风醉忘归，高堂月落烛已微，玉钗挂缨君莫违。,Romantic,Li Bai,The second of the three dance songs and lyrics,"The moon is cold and the river is clear and the night is deep, and the beauty smiles a thousand gold. Chuiluo dances and mourns, the snow in Yingzhong is silent, and the midnight Wu song moves the king's heart. If you move your heart, you will appreciate it. I would like to be a pair of mandarin ducks in Tianchi, and fly to Qingyun once. Wu Dao cuts and sews dance clothes, bright make-up and beautiful clothes capture the brilliance of spring. Raise your eyebrows and turn your sleeves like snowflakes, alluring and independent, rare in the world. Excited by the wind and drunk in Chu, I forget to return, the moon in the high hall is already low, and the jade hairpin hangs on the tassel."

The grass is overgrown, and the cool wind is blowing. Under the autumn leaves, the moon is cold and Shaji is sad. Sit and worry about the rest of the group, and the white dew withers. The yellow leaves of Yan's family are falling, and the concubine looks forward to Bai on the stage. The moon rises, the green clouds break, and the sound of cicadas comes in autumn. Hu Bing Sha Saihe, and the Han sent Yuguan back. There is no return day for conquerors, and the grass is destroyed in empty sorrow."
浪漫,李白,琴曲歌辞 飞龙引二首,唐,黄帝铸鼎于荆山，鍊丹砂。丹砂成黄金，骑龙飞上太清家。云愁海思令人嗟，宫中綵女颜如花。飘然挥手凌紫霞，从风纵体登銮车。登銮车，侍轩辕。遨游青天中，其乐不可言。鼎湖流水清且闲，轩辕去时有弓剑。古人传道留其间，后宫婵娟多花颜。乘鸾飞烟亦不还，骑龙攀天造天关。造天关，闻天语，长云河车载玉女。载玉女，过紫皇，紫皇乃赐白兔所捣之药，后天而老凋三光。下视瑶池见王母，蛾眉萧飒如秋霜。,Romantic,Li Bai,Two Piano Songs Cited by Flying Dragons,"The Yellow Emperor cast a tripod in Jingshan, chained with cinnabar. The cinnabar turns into gold, and rides a dragon to Taiqing's house. Yunchou Haisi makes people sigh, and the beauty of the palace is like a flower. Flutteringly waved Ling Zixia's hands, and boarded the car from the wind. Board the Luan car and serve Xuanyuan. Soaring in the blue sky is a joy beyond words. The flowing water of Dinghu Lake is clear and leisurely, and there are bows and swords when Xuanyuan goes. The ancients preached and kept it, and the harem was full of beauty. Riding on a luan and flying smoke will not return, riding a dragon to climb the sky and build the sky. Create Tianguan, hear the language of heaven, and the Changyun River carries the jade girl. Zai Yunv passed the Zihuang, who gave the medicine pounded by the white rabbit, and it will wither away the day after tomorrow. Looking down at Yaochi to see the Queen Mother, her crescent eyebrows are as rustling as autumn frost."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 前有一尊酒行二首,唐,春风东来忽相过，金尊绿酒生微波。落花纷纷稍觉多，美人欲醉朱颜酡。青轩桃李能几何？流光欺人忽蹉跎。君起舞，日西夕，当年意气不肯倾，白发如丝叹何益。琴奏龙门之绿桐，玉壶美酒清若空。催弦拂柱与君饮，看朱成碧颜始红。胡姬貌如花，当炉笑春风。笑春风，舞罗衣，君今不醉欲安归。,Romantic,Li Bai,There is a wine shop in front of the lyrics of miscellaneous songs and two poems,"The spring breeze comes from the east and passes by suddenly, and the golden green wine produces microwaves. The falling flowers feel a little bit more, and the beauties want to get drunk. How many peaches and plums can Qingxuan have? The streamer is deceiving and wasted. You dance, day and night, when the spirit refused to give up, white hair like silk, sighing what benefit. The qin plays the green tung tree of Longmen, and the jade pot of fine wine is as clear as empty. Urging the strings and brushing the pillars to drink with the king, seeing Zhu Chengbiyan becoming red. Orchid looks like a flower, smiling like a spring breeze. Laughing at the spring breeze, dancing Luo Yi, you are not drunk now and want to return home in peace."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 少年行二首,唐,击筑饮美酒，剑歌易水湄。经过燕太子，结托并州儿。少年负壮气，奋烈自有时。因声鲁句践，争情勿相欺。五陵年少金市东，银鞍白马度春风。落花踏尽游何处？笑入胡姬酒肆中。,Romantic,Li Bai,Two Poems of Miscellaneous Songs and Lyrics,"Fight to build and drink fine wine, swords and songs are easy to drink. After passing through Prince Yan, he was entrusted with Bingzhouer. Young people are full of courage, and sometimes they are fierce. Don't bully each other because of the sound, Lu and sentence practice. Wuling is young and gold is in the east, and the silver saddle and white horse spend the spring breeze. Where do the fallen flowers go? Laughing into the orchid restaurant."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 长相思三首,唐,日色已尽花含烟，月明欲素愁不眠。赵瑟初停凤凰柱，蜀琴欲奏鸳鸯弦。此曲有意无人传，愿随春风寄燕然，忆君迢迢隔青天。昔日横波目，今成流泪泉。不信妾肠断，归来看取明镜前。美人在时花满堂，美人去后空馀床。床中绣被卷不寝，至今三载犹闻香。香亦竟不灭，人亦竟不来。相思黄叶落，白露点青苔。长相思，在长安，络纬秋啼金井阑。微霜凄凄簟色寒，孤灯不明思欲绝。卷帷望月空长叹，美人如花隔云端。上有青冥之长天，下有渌水之波澜。天长路远魂飞苦，梦魂不到关山难。长相思，摧心肝。,Romantic,Li Bai,Three Miscellaneous Songs and Lyrics of Long Lovesickness,"The sun is gone, flowers and smoke are gone, and the moon is full of sorrow and sleeplessness. Zhao Sechu stopped the Phoenix Column, and the Shuqin wanted to play the mandarin duck strings. This song is intended to be passed on by no one, and I would like to send it to Yanran with the spring breeze, recalling you across the blue sky. In the past, Hengbomu has become a fountain of tears. If you don't believe me, my concubine will be heartbroken, and I will come back to see the mirror. When the beauties are here, the house is full of flowers, and when the beauties go, there is no bed left. The embroidered quilt in the bed can't sleep, and it still smells fragrant for three years. The fragrance is not extinguished, and people do not come. Acacia yellow leaves fall, white dew spots moss. Sauvignon Blanc, in Chang'an, Luo Weiqiu cries Jinjinglan. Weishuang is desolate, the color is cold, and the solitary lamp is incomprehensible. Roll up the curtain and look at the moon and sky and sigh, the beauty is like a flower separated by clouds. There is a long sky of Qingming above, and there are waves of Lushui below. The sky is long, the road is far away, the soul is flying, and the dream soul cannot reach Guanshan. Sauvignon Blanc breaks the heart."
浪漫,李白,杂曲歌辞 行路难三首,唐,金尊清酒斗十千，玉盘珍羞直万钱。停杯投箸不能食，拔剑四顾心茫然。欲渡黄河冰塞川，将登太行雪暗天。闲来垂钓坐溪上，忽复乘舟梦日边。行路难，行路难，多岐路，今安在？长风破浪会有时，直挂云帆济沧海。大道如青天，我独不得出。羞逐长安社中儿，赤鸡白狗赌梨栗。弹剑作歌奏苦声，曳裾王门不称情。淮阴市井笑韩信，汉朝公卿忌贾生。君不见昔时燕家重郭隗，拥彗折腰无嫌猜。剧辛乐毅感恩分，输肝剖胆效英才。昭王白骨萦蔓草，谁人更扫黄金台。行路难，归去来。有耳莫洗颍川水，有口莫食首阳蕨。含光混世贵无名，何用孤高比云月。吾观自古贤达人，功成不退皆殒身。子胥既弃吴江上，屈原终投湘水滨。陆机才多岂自保，李斯税驾苦不早。华亭鹤唳讵可闻，上蔡苍鹰何足道？君不见吴中张翰称达士，秋风忽忆江东行。且乐生前一杯酒，何须身后千载名。,Romantic,Li Bai,Three Miscellaneous Songs,"Jinzun's wine bucket is worth ten thousand, and the jade plate is ashamed to sell for tens of thousands of dollars. Stopping the cup and throwing the chopsticks, I can't eat, I draw my sword and look around in a daze. If you want to cross the Yellow River, which is blocked by ice, you will climb the snowy sky of Taihang. When I am free to fish and sit on the stream, I suddenly take a boat and dream of the sun. The road is difficult, the road is difficult, there are many roads, where is it now? There will be times when the wind and the waves cleave, hang the clouds and sail straight to the sea. The avenue is like the blue sky, I can't get it alone. Ashamed of chasing children in Chang'an society, red chickens and white dogs bet on pears and chestnuts. Playing swords, singing songs and playing bitter voices, dragging the king's door is not sympathetic. The market in Huaiyin laughed at Han Xin, and the officials of the Han Dynasty hated Jia Sheng. Don't you see that in the past, the Yan family valued Guo Kui, and they had no doubts about Hui Hui. The drama Xin Leyi is grateful, and the infusion of the liver and gallbladder is effective for talents. King Zhao's bones linger in the weeds, who will sweep the golden platform more. Difficult to travel, go back. If you have ears, don't wash Yingchuan water; if you have mouth, don't eat Shouyang fern. Hanguang is expensive and nameless in the world, so what's the use of being lonely and taller than Yunyue. In my view, since ancient times, sages and virtuous people will perish if they do not retreat. Zixu abandoned the Wujiang River, and Qu Yuan finally threw himself into the Xiang River. How can Lu Ji protect himself if he has so many talents? Cranes in Huating can be heard, but what is the goshawk in Shangcai? Don't you see that Zhang Han in Wuzhong is called Dashi, and the autumn wind suddenly recalls Jiangdong. And if you have a glass of wine before your death, why do you need to be famous for thousands of years after you die?"

When Jiangcheng returns to Lushui, the flowers and the moon are fascinating. When the monkey was drunk, he went down to Xiangyang. The head is white, and the horse is riding backwards. Xianshan is adjacent to the Han River, and the water is clear and the sand is like snow. There is a stele of tears on it, and the moss has faded away for a long time.

Eight wildernesses opened up the Shouyu area, turning Hongjun in one breath. Lin Yu thinks about the virtuous, and Danqing recalls the old minister. If you ask for a horse according to the picture, you will get a unicorn instead. The sand is eliminated, the rivers are turbid, and the Ding Nai is reconciled. Wei Xian first met Han, and Fan Shu returned to Qin. Shengye is like this today, and the scriptures are passed on. Yuzhang is deep in the ground, and the sea is wide and there is no Tianjin. The mouthpiece of Beidou Division, the leader of the East. Stay balanced and learn from algae, and listen to the stars. Only when you are alone can you surpass the ancient times, and Yu Bode shines on your neighbors. Smarter than Guan Ren, ruler and slippery than Chen Zun. Is it a thing in the pool? It comes from the treasure on the table. The temple knows the truth, and the customs are pure. Talented and outstanding are all used, but stupid but hidden. Changqing has been ill for a long time, and Zixia lives frequently. Looking back to drive away the customs, life is like everyone. Don't ask about Wuxian, Zou Lu doesn't let you go. It will be late to be grateful, and the vastness will be happy. For the public song this song, tears in the clothes towel."
现实,杜甫,上白帝城二首 其一,唐,江城含变态，一上一回新。天欲今朝雨，山归万古春。英雄馀事业，衰迈久风尘。取醉他乡客，相逢故国人。兵戈犹拥蜀，赋敛强输秦。不是烦形胜，深惭畏损神。,Reality,Du Fu,One of the two poems in Shangbaidi City,"Jiangcheng contains perverts, one new one. The sky wants to rain today, and the mountains return to eternal spring. The hero has more than his career, but he has been old for a long time. Get drunk with guests from other countries, and meet people from the motherland. Bing Ge still embraces Shu, Fu collects and loses to Qin. It's not that it's annoying to win, and it's deeply ashamed and afraid of hurting the spirit."
现实,杜甫,上白帝城二首 其二,唐,白帝空祠庙，孤云自往来。江山城宛转，栋宇客裴回。勇略今何在，当年亦壮哉。后人将酒肉，虚殿日尘埃。谷鸟鸣还过，林花落又开。多惭病无力，骑马入青苔。,Reality,Du Fu,Shangbaidi City Two Poems,"Baidi's ancestral temple is empty, and lonely clouds come and go. The city of Jiangshan is turning around, and the guest of Dongyu is returning. Where is the bravery now, it was also strong back then. Later generations use wine and meat, and the empty palace is full of dust. The song of the valley birds has passed, and the forest flowers have fallen and bloomed again. How ashamed and weak, riding a horse into the moss."
现实,杜甫,与严二郎奉礼别,唐,别君谁暖眼，将老病缠身。出涕同斜日，临风看去尘。商歌还入夜，巴俗自为邻。尚愧微躯在，遥闻盛礼新。山东群盗散，阙下受降频。诸将归应尽，题书报旅人。,Reality,Du Fu,Farewell to Yan Erlang,"Don't warm your eyes, you will be plagued by old illness. Tearing out the same slanting sun, facing the wind to look at the dust. The commercial song is still at night, and the common people are neighbors. I am still ashamed of my body, and I have heard about the new ceremony from afar. The bandits in Shandong dispersed, and Que Xia was lowered in frequency. All the generals should return, and write a book to report to the traveler."
现实,杜甫,与李十二白同寻范十隐居,唐,李侯有佳句，往往似阴铿。余亦东蒙客，怜君如弟兄。醉眠秋共被，携手日同行。更想幽期处，还寻北郭生。入门高兴发，侍立小童清。落景闻寒杵，屯云对古城。向来吟橘颂，谁欲讨莼羹。不愿论簪笏，悠悠沧海情。,Reality,Du Fu,Searching for Fan Shi to live in seclusion with Li Shibai,"Li Hou has good sentences, which are often like Yin Keng. Yu Yidong is a guest, pity Jun as a brother. Drunk and sleeping together in autumn, walking hand in hand with the sun. I even want to live in a secluded period, and I also look for Bei Guosheng. I am happy to get started, and I will serve Xiao Tongqing. Fallen scenery smells the cold pestle, Tunyun faces the ancient city. I have always chanted orange odes, who wants to ask for water shield soup. I don't want to talk about the hairpin wat, and I want to talk about the sea."
现实,杜甫,千秋节有感二首 其一,唐,自罢千秋节，频伤八月来。先朝常宴会，壮观已尘埃。凤纪编生日，龙池堑劫灰。湘川新涕泪，秦树远楼台。宝镜群臣得，金吾万国回。衢尊不重饮，白首独馀哀。,Reality,Du Fu,Feelings about the Thousand Autumn Festival,"Since the Qianqiu Festival, August has been frequently hurt. First go to the regular banquet, the spectacle has been dusted. Feng Ji's birthday is written, and Longchi's moat is ashes. Xiangchuan has new tears, and Qin Shu is far away from the tower. The ministers of the precious mirror get it, and the Jinwu and all nations return. Qu Zun does not drink heavily, and mourns alone with his white head."

The Guijiang River flows north, sending waves everywhere."
现实,杜甫,大云寺赞公房四首 其一,唐,心在水精域，衣沾春雨时。洞门尽徐步，深院果幽期。到扉开复闭，撞钟斋及兹。醍醐长发性，饮食过扶衰。把臂有多日，开怀无愧辞。黄鹂度结构，紫鸽下罘罳。愚意会所适，花边行自迟。汤休起我病，微笑索题诗。,Reality,Du Fu,One of Four Poems Praising Gongfang in Dayun Temple,"The heart is in the water essence, when the clothes are covered with spring rain. Walk slowly through the cave gate, and the deep courtyard is in a quiet period. When the door opens and closes again, hit the bell and fast. It's long-haired, and eating too much can help the decline. It's been a long time since I held my arm, and I resigned with no regrets. The structure of the oriole is the structure, and the purple pigeon is under the 罘罳. If you are stupid, you will be comfortable, and lace will be late. Tang Xiu woke up from my illness and asked for a poem with a smile."
现实,杜甫,大云寺赞公房四首 其二,唐,细软青丝履，光明白氎巾。深藏供老宿，取用及吾身。自顾转无趣，交情何尚新。道林才不世，惠远德过人。雨泻暮檐竹，风吹青井芹。天阴对图画，最觉润龙鳞。,Reality,Du Fu,The second of the four poems of Zan Gongfang in Dayun Temple,"Soft green silk shoes, bright and white scarves. Hidden deep for the old place, taking and using it and my body. Self care turns boring, friendship is still new. Daolin is immortal, but Huiyuande is extraordinary. Bamboo on the eaves of the evening rain, wind blowing Qingjing celery. Tianyin is most fond of pictures when it comes to moistening dragon scales."
现实,杜甫,大云寺赞公房四首 其三,唐,灯影照无睡，心清闻妙香。夜深殿突兀，风动金锒铛。天黑闭春院，地清栖暗芳。玉绳回断绝，铁凤森翱翔。梵放时出寺，钟残仍殷床。明朝在沃野，苦见尘沙黄。,Reality,Du Fu,Three of the Four Poems of Zan Gongfang in Dayun Temple,"The shadow of the lamp shines without sleep, and the heart is clear and smells the wonderful fragrance. In the middle of the night, the hall is abrupt, and the wind moves the golden clang. It's dark and the spring courtyard is closed, and the ground is clear and the place is dark and fragrant. The jade rope was cut off, and Tie Fengsen soared. When the Vatican left the temple, Zhong Can was still in bed. The Ming Dynasty was in the fertile field, and it was hard to see the dust and sand yellow."
现实,杜甫,大云寺赞公房四首 其四,唐,童儿汲井华，惯捷瓶上手。沾洒不濡地，埽除似无帚。明霞烂复阁，霁雾搴高牖。侧塞被径花，飘飖委墀柳。艰难世事迫，隐遁佳期后。晤语契深心，那能总钳口。奉辞还杖策，暂别终回首。泱泱泥污人，听听国多狗。既未免羁绊，时来憩奔走。近公如白雪，执热烦何有。,Reality,Du Fu,Four Poems of Zan Gongfang in Dayun Temple,"Tonger draws Jinghua, and is used to the bottle. The ground is not wetted, and it seems that there is no broom in addition to it. Mingxia died and returned to the pavilion, and the fog was high. The side plug is covered with flowers in the diameter, and the willows are floating in the air. The world is difficult and the world is pressing, after the good time is hidden. The language agreement is deep in the heart, and it can always be in the jaws. Resignation is also a policy, and I will look back for a while. A lot of muddy people, listen to the country and more dogs. Since it is not free from fetters, it is time to rest and run. My neighbor is like Bai Xue, why is it bothering me to be hot?"
现实,杜甫,大历三年春白帝城放船出瞿塘峡久居夔府将适江陵漂泊有诗凡四十韵,唐,老向巴人里，今辞楚塞隅。入舟翻不乐，解缆独长吁。窄转深啼狖，虚随乱浴凫。石苔凌几杖，空翠扑肌肤。叠壁排霜剑，奔泉溅水珠。杳冥藤上下，浓澹树荣枯。神女峰娟妙，昭君宅有无。曲留明怨惜，梦尽失欢娱。摆阖盘涡沸，欹斜激浪输。风雷缠地脉，冰雪耀天衢。鹿角真走险，狼头如跋胡。恶滩宁变色，高卧负微躯。书史全倾挠，装囊半压濡。生涯临臬兀，死地脱斯须。不有平川决，焉知众壑趋。乾坤霾涨海，雨露洗春芜。欧鸟牵丝飏，骊龙濯锦纡。落霞沈绿绮，残月坏金枢。泥笋苞初荻，沙茸出小蒲。雁儿争水马，燕子逐樯乌。绝岛容烟雾，环洲纳晓晡。前闻辨陶牧，转眄拂宜都。县郭南畿好，津亭北望孤。劳心依憩息，朗咏划昭苏。意遣乐还笑，衰迷贤与愚。飘萧将素发，汨没听洪炉。丘壑曾忘返，文章敢自诬。此生遭圣代，谁分哭穷途。卧疾淹为客，蒙恩早厕儒。廷争酬造化，朴直乞江湖。滟滪险相迫，沧浪深可逾。浮名寻已已，懒计却区区。喜近天皇寺，先披古画图。应经帝子渚，同泣舜苍梧。朝士兼戎服，君王按湛卢。旄头初俶扰，鹑首丽泥涂。甲卒身虽贵，书生道固殊。出尘皆野鹤，历块匪辕驹。伊吕终难降，韩彭不易呼。五云高太甲，六月旷抟扶。回首黎元病，争权将帅诛。山林托疲苶，未必免崎岖。,Reality,Du Fu,"In the spring of the third year of the Dali calendar, the Baidi City released the boat out of the Qutang Gorge, and lived in the Kui Mansion for a long time.","used to go to Barenli, but now I am leaving Chusaiyu. Entering the boat turned unhappy, let go alone long cry. Narrow to deep crying, empty and chaotic bathing. There are a few sticks of stone moss, and the empty emerald flutters on the skin. Frost-dispelling swords stacked on the wall, splashing water droplets from the rushing spring. Yaoming vines go up and down, thick and thin trees flourish and wither. Goddess Fengjuanmiao, whether Zhaojun's house is there or not. Qu Liuming resents and regrets, and all dreams lose joy. The vortex boils when the plate is closed, and the wave is lost by the oblique Dew. The wind and thunder entangle the veins of the earth, and the ice and snow shine on the sky. The antlers are really dangerous, and the wolf's head is like a beard. Evil Tanning changes color, lying high and negative. The history of the book is all overturned, half-packed and moistened. Life is in the standard, and death is off the silk beard. If there is no Pingchuan decision, how can we know the trend of all people. The haze of the universe rises to the sea, and the rain and dew wash the spring. Ou Niao pulls silk, and Lilong washes brocade. The setting sun sinks into the green qi, and the waning moon destroys the golden hub. Mud bamboo shoots are just beginning to grow, and scallops come out of small cattails. Geese compete for water and horses, swallows chase crows. Absolutely the island contains smog, and the island is surrounded by dawn. I heard and identified Tao Mu before, and turned to Yidu. The south of the county is good, and the Jinting looks lonely in the north. Work hard and take a rest, and sing aloud to draw Zhaosu. I want to send joy and laugh, and I am fascinated by the virtuous and the stupid. Floating Xiao Jiang plain hair, Mi did not listen to the Hong furnace. Qiu Gu once forgot to return, and the article dared to frame himself. In this life, who suffers from a sundae, who will cry poorly. Lying sick and drowning as a guest, I am grateful to the early toilet Confucianism. The court strives for good fortune, and honesty begs for the rivers and lakes. The dangers of twilight are pressing each other, and the waves are deep and deep. I have found my name, but I am lazy. If you are close to Tianhuang Temple, you should put on ancient paintings first. Should be the emperor's son Zhu, weeping with Shun Cangwu. Court scholars and military uniforms, the king according to Zhanlu. The head of the head is disturbed at the beginning, and the head of the quail is painted with mud. Although the body of a soldier is expensive, the way of a scholar is very special. All the wild cranes come out of the dust, and the calendar blocks are bandits. It is difficult for Yilu to surrender, and it is not easy for Han Peng to call out. Five clouds are high in Taijia, and June is Kuang Tuanfu. Looking back on Li Yuan's illness, the generals who fought for power will be punished. The mountains and forests are exhausted, but they are not necessarily rugged."
现实,杜甫,元日示宗武,唐,汝啼吾手战，吾笑汝身长。处处逢正月，迢迢滞远方。飘零还柏酒，衰病只藜床。训喻青衿子，名惭白首郎。赋诗犹落笔，献寿更称觞。不见江东弟，高歌泪数行。,Reality,Du Fu,Shi Zongwu,"You cry and I fight with my hands, and I laugh at your length. The first month is everywhere, and the distance is far away. The cypress wine is drifting away, and the sickness is only a quinoa bed. The training Yu Qingjinzi, whose name is Shame Baishoulang. Composing poems is like writing a pen, and offering a birthday is more called a cup. Seeing Brother Jiangdong, I sang and cried for a few lines."
现实,杜甫,天池,唐,天池马不到，岚壁鸟才通。百顷青云杪，层波白石中。郁纡腾秀气，萧瑟浸寒空。直对巫山出，兼疑夏禹功。鱼龙开辟有，菱芡古今同。闻道奔雷黑，初看浴日红。飘零神女雨，断续楚王风。欲问支机石，如临献宝宫。九秋惊雁序，万里狎渔翁。更是无人处，诛茅任薄躬。,Reality,Du Fu,Tianchi,"If the Tianchi horse can't reach it, the Lanbi bird can. Hundreds of hectares of blue clouds, among layers of waves and white stones. Delicate and delicate, bleak and soaking in the cold air. Go straight to Wushan, and doubt Xia Yugong. Ichthyosaurs have been developed, and Lingqian is the same in ancient and modern times. I heard that Ben Lei is black, and I saw the sun is red for the first time. The rain of the goddess drifts, and the wind of the king of Chu intermittently. If you want to ask about the machine stone, it's like coming to Xianbao Palace. Nine autumns startled geese preface, thousands of miles of sex with fisherman. There is no one else, and Zhu Mao Ren Bo bows."
现实,杜甫,太岁日,唐,楚岸行将老，巫山坐复春。病多犹是客，谋拙竟何人。阊阖开黄道，衣冠拜紫宸。荣光悬日月，赐与出金银。愁寂鸳行断，参差虎穴邻。西江元下蜀，北斗故临秦。散地逾高枕，生涯脱要津。天边梅柳树，相见几回新。,Reality,Du Fu,Tai Sui Day,"Chu An is about to grow old, and Wu Shan is rejuvenated. If you are sick, you are still a guest, but who is the clumsy planner? The ecliptic is opened, and the clothes are worshiped by Zichen. The glory hangs on the sun and the moon, and bestows gold and silver. The lonely mandarin duck is broken, and the tiger's den is scattered. Xijiang Yuan went to Shu, and Beidou came to Qin. Scattered places are more than high pillows, and life is off the essentials. Plum and willow trees in the sky, meet each other several times."
现实,杜甫,风疾舟中伏枕书怀三十六韵奉呈湖南亲友,唐,轩辕休制律，虞舜罢弹琴。尚错雄鸣管，犹伤半死心。圣贤名古邈，羁旅病年侵。舟泊常依震，湖平早见参。如闻马融笛，若倚仲宣襟。故国悲寒望，群云惨岁阴。水乡霾白屋，枫岸叠青岑。郁郁冬炎瘴，濛濛雨滞淫。鼓迎非祭鬼，弹落似鸮禽。兴尽才无闷，愁来遽不禁。生涯相汨没，时物自萧森。疑惑尊中弩，淹留冠上簪。牵裾惊魏帝，投阁为刘歆。狂走终奚适，微才谢所钦。吾安藜不糁，汝贵玉为琛。乌几重重缚，鹑衣寸寸针。哀伤同庾信，述作异陈琳。十暑岷山葛，三霜楚户砧。叨陪锦帐座，久放白头吟。反朴时难遇，忘机陆易沈。应过数粒食，得近四知金。春草封归恨，源花费独寻。转蓬忧悄悄，行药病涔涔。瘗夭追潘岳，持危觅邓林。蹉跎翻学步，感激在知音。却假苏张舌，高誇周宋镡。纳流迷浩汗，峻址得嵚崟。城府开清旭，松筠起碧浔。披颜争倩倩，逸足竞骎骎。朗鉴存愚直，皇天实照临。公孙仍恃险，侯景未生擒。书信中原阔，干戈北斗深。畏人千里井，问俗九州箴。战血流依旧，军声动至今。葛洪尸定解，许靖力还任。家事丹砂诀，无成涕作霖。,Reality,Du Fu,Thirty-six rhymes in the book on the pillow in the wind and the boat are presented to relatives and friends in Hunan,"Xuanyuan stopped playing the rhythm, and Yu Shun stopped playing the piano. It's still half-hearted to miss the male syrinx. The sage's name is Gu Miao, who has been invading for years due to illness. The boats and parks often depend on the earthquake, and the lake level can be seen early. If you hear the flute of Ma Rong, if you lean on Zhongxuan's lapel. The motherland is sad and cold, and the clouds are miserable. Hazy white house in the water town, green cens stacked on the maple bank. Depressed winter and miasma, misty rain stagnates prostitution. Drums welcome non-sacrificing ghosts, and the flicks fall like owls. There is no boredom when you are exhausted, and you can't help worrying. Career is lost, and things come from Xiao Sen. Doubt is in the middle of the crossbow, and the hairpin on the crown is drowned. Pulling the train to surprise Emperor Wei, he voted for Liu Xin. At the end of the mad walk, Xi Shi, Wei Cai thanked Suoqin. I am not grits, but your precious jade is Chen. The crows are heavily bound, and the quail clothes are stitched every inch of the needle. Sorrow is the same as Yu Xin, and the description is different from Chen Lin. Min Shange in ten summers, Chuhu anvil in three frosts. Stay with the brocade tent seat, and put the white head to chant for a long time. It is rare to meet when you are against Park, and it is easy to sink when you forget the opportunity. If you eat a few grains, you will get nearly four gold. The spring grass is sealed and hated, and the source is spent alone. Turn Peng worry quietly, practice medicine sickness. Yu Yao pursues Pan Yue, and looks for Deng Lin in danger. I wasted my time learning how to walk, and I am grateful for my bosom friend. But pretending to be Su Zhangtong, exaggerating Zhou Songtan. Naliu Mihao Khan, the site is worthless. The city mansion opens Qingxu, and Songyun starts Bixun. Wearing face to compete for beauty, leisure feet to compete for beauty. Lang Jian saves stupidity and straightness, and the emperor's day is true. Gongsun still relied on danger, but Hou Jing was not captured alive. The letter is broad in the Central Plains, and the battle with the Big Dipper is deep. Fear people thousands of miles well, ask the vulgar Kyushu proverbs. The blood of the war is still flowing, and the voice of the army is still alive. Ge Hong's body will be released, and Xu Jingli will return. The cinnabar formula of family affairs is nothing but tears."
现实,杜甫,东屯月夜,唐,抱疾漂萍老，防边旧谷屯。春农亲异俗，岁月在衡门。青女霜枫重，黄牛峡水喧。泥留虎斗迹，月挂客愁村。乔木澄稀影，轻云倚细根。数惊闻雀噪，暂睡想猿蹲。日转东方白，风来北斗昏。天寒不成寝，无梦寄归魂。,Reality,Du Fu,Dongtun Moonlight Night,"Pai Ping old with illness, old Gutun on the frontier. Chunnong is close to the customs, and the years are in Hengmen. The green girl is heavy with frost and maple, and the water in Huangniu Gorge is noisy. There are traces of tigers fighting in the mud, and the moon hangs in the village of sorrow. The trees are clear and thin, and the clouds lean on the thin roots. I was surprised to hear the noise of sparrows, and I wanted to sleep for a while and want to squat like apes. The sun turns white in the east, and the wind blows to the Big Dipper. It's too cold to sleep, no dream to return to the soul."

Strictly guarded and polite, the palm festival is very important. Outside the early cold of Biwa, the golden stem is beside it. Mountains and rivers help embroidery households, the sun and the moon are close to carved beams. The fairy plums have big roots, and the Yilan Yiyeguang. The old history of the family is left behind, and the morality is the king of the present. Painters look at their predecessors, Wu Shengyuan is good at field. Senluo moves the axis of the earth, and it is wonderful to move the palace wall. The Five Sages are united by Long Dun, and thousands of officials are flying geese. The crown and the hair are all beautiful, and the Jing is flying. The green cypresses stay in the scene, and the red pears get frost. The kite blows the jade pillar, and the dew well freezes the silver bed. He retired from the humble Zhou family, and was passed down to the emperor of Han Dynasty. If the god of the valley is not dead, where is the place to raise the clumsy."
现实,杜甫,冬晚送长孙渐舍人归州,唐,参卿休坐幄，荡子不还乡。南客潇湘外，西戎鄠杜旁。衰年倾盖晚，费日系舟长。会面思来札，销魂逐去樯。云晴鸥更舞，风逆雁无行。匣里雌雄剑，吹毛任选将。,Reality,Du Fu,Send grandson Jiansheren back to the state in the evening of winter,"Shen Qing sits on the tent, and the prodigal son does not return home. Outside Xiaoxiang in the south, beside Xirong Hudu. In the old age, it was late, and Fei Ri was the captain of the boat. Meeting and thinking about letters, ecstasy drives away the mast. The clouds are clear and the gulls dance more, but the wind is against the geese. There are male and female swords in the box, and you can choose your general by blowing hair."
现实,杜甫,北风,唐,春生南国瘴，气待北风苏。向晚霾残日，初宵鼓大炉。爽携卑湿地，声拔洞庭湖。万里鱼龙伏，三更鸟兽呼。涤除贪破浪，愁绝付摧枯。执热沈沈在，凌寒往往须。且知宽疾肺，不敢恨危途。再宿烦舟子，衰容问仆夫。今晨非盛怒，便道即长驱。隐几看帆席，云州涌坐隅。,Reality,Du Fu,north wind,"The miasma of the southern country is born in spring, and the air is waiting for the north wind to revive. Towards the evening haze and the dying sun, the early night is full of fire. Shuang carries the low wetland, and the sound pulls Dongting Lake. Thousands of miles of fish and dragons are lying down, and birds and beasts are calling in the third watch. Get rid of greed and break the waves, and worry about it. The persistent heat sinks, and the coldness often suffocates. And know the disease of the lungs, dare not hate the dangerous road. No matter how annoying the boatman is, he will ask his servant. This morning, if you are not angry, you will drive on the sidewalk. Looking at the sail seats for a while, Yunzhou is sitting in a corner."

The flying rain moves the Chinese house, Xiao Xiao Liang Dongqiu. If you are poor, you will be ashamed of your confidant, and you will take advantage of your early teeth. It has been spent in the early morning, and the grown-up seeks. Undress and open the north door, sleep on the south building. The tree is wet and the wind is cool, and the river is noisy and the water is floating. The ceremony is soothing and the heart is comfortable, and the festival is cool and the disease is slightly cured. The master will return to Tiaoding, and I will also visit Jiuqiu."

Xijing is tired of many battles, and Beique is the leader of the gang. The gate is three thousand miles away, and the fireworks are ten thousand.

The remaining part of the desolate song, the sound of the old family. The carved osprey goes there in time, and the master of Hualiu sings. Difficulty calls for the best strategy, and easy is the future. The slanting sun is the roof of the pavilion, and the high wind blows the Jingjing. The pine is sad, the sky is cold and the water is cold, the sand is chaotic, the snow is chaotic, and the mountains are clear. He is still pregnant with the captives, and dare not be surprised when defending the frontier. From ancient times in a foreign land, calmness shows special symptoms. Yanji rushed to seal the hog, and Zhou Qin touched the whale. How miserable is the Central Plains, and the remaining evils are still rampant. Arrows enter the Zhaoyang Palace, and Jia sings in the Xiliu camp. The wife is weeping with red sleeves, and the prince walks in white clothes.

He is from Weiban, and Zhou Xing sits alone. It is engraved with the shoulders, and the short hair is placed on the hairpin tassel. I want to follow Liu Biao, but I still doubt and loathe You Heng. Gradually decline that farewell, endure tears alone with love. The fox speaks in the abandoned city, and the tiger and leopard fight in the empty village.

Respect and look to the ground, and let go of memory. Zhuojiu looks for Tao Ling, and Dansha visits Ge Hong. The rivers and lakes are short and brown, and the frost and snow are full of flying canopies. The universe is big, and the Taoism of Zhou is empty.

The world of Jianbiao is vast, and it is absolutely fascinating from ancient to modern times. The gods are very angry, and the grace is low. The prime minister is clear and discusses the public, and the Confucianism is well-known. Xuanmian Luo Tianque, Lin Lang knows Jiegui. Poems by actors and officials must be recited, and Kui's music dictionaries are still to be read. Jianbi Ling parrot, Feng Ying grebe. You are all tall and straight, and everyone looks forward to each clue. The general book is more than Qingsuo, and the road shines on Zini. Lingqiu passed on the evening arrow, and returned to the horse to scatter the hooves. Can re-translate, Jiamo and Yuanli. When Bi Xie Fang exhibits, the order of the class will be even higher. Shiyue Kong stumbled, Youliang was miserable. False knowledge will eventually draw a tiger, and differentiation is a chicken. Ping Fan has no days off, and Tao Yin misses the old trail. Bragging is envied by people, but things are still wrong. The blue sea is really difficult to ford, and the blue clouds cannot be laddered.

When you enter the curtain, you know Sun Chu, and you get Zheng Qiao in your lapel. The father-in-law borrowed his talent, and his family was as high as the sky. The old man is flattering and clumsy, and he is better than Qi Tuorao. Give money to the house to wait, and fight for rice to be stationed in the boat. Neighbors are so difficult and thin, and their hearts are focused. Accompanied by the starry sky, the cold water does not become a tide. The plain hair is dry and the collar is hanging down, and the silver medal is broken at the waist. Saying poetry can make you tired all night, drunk or even go to court. Zao Han only leads the rate, and the lake and the mountain are shaken. Shi Qing is not a fault, but the prosperity is exhausted but the depression is depressed. The emperor is very kind, and the common people turn lonely. Hugh said that a deer is a horse, but Mo believes that it is like an owl. Unsolved Yiyixiong, but also poured a ladle.

The crime is cruel and lenient, but the fight is not open. Xingshuang changed into a mysterious bird, and her life experience was reminded by Baiju. The pillow is over-slipped, and the boat is allowed to come and go. Nine diamonds make fire, and three stings thunder in Chu Temple. Emperor Wang's biography should be true, but King Zhao did not answer his questions. Jiao Chi is deep and horizontal, jackals and tigers are chaotic and guessing.

He has been in the public office for a long time, but his son is handsome and talented. The long road is more persistent, and this heart is still in the clothes. Gratitude is not small, and nostalgia is not violated. The tomb is waiting for the imperial edict of Longxiang, and the stage is welcoming Xiezhi's prestige. Seeing the rules of scholars from the bottom of our hearts, the elegance lies in the military machine. Rong Di took advantage of the evil spirit, and the dust fell into the forbidden room. In previous years, the dynasty was broken, but in the future it will be impossible. But to promote the copper pot and arrow, don't add the jade tent flag. Ask Mr. Huang Ge, and he is willing to consider Bai Dengwei. All surnames are wounded and united, and the group of fierce people is addicted to fat.

The authors are all listed, and their reputations are not worth mentioning. It is a pity that the poets do not see it, and the Taoism of the Han Dynasty is prosperous here. The predecessors soared in, and the aftermath was beautiful. Later sages and old columns, each dynasties have clear regulations. The law comes from Confucianism, and the heart is weak and tired. Yonghuai Jiang Zuoyi is very sick in Yezhongqi. All the horses are good horses, and the horses are good. The wheels have been broken, but the pity is still lost. Spreading the theory of latent husbands, falsely spreading the stele of young women. Fate and comfort drifting, repeatedly migrating with illness. Ashamed of the long-term economic strategy, fly and leave a branch. Dust and sand are surrounded by bees and worms, and rivers and gorge are surrounded by dragons and dragons.

Driving can't be said, talking and laughing are the same occasionally. Daoshu once paid attention to it, and Mr. hit Mongolia early. Every family welcomes Jizi, and knows Hu Gong everywhere. Shouting to the north of Emei, sneaking to the east of Yulei. Sometimes riding a tiger, the virtual room makes a fairy boy. When the hair is less, it will be whiter, but when the face is weak, it will be redder. Wang Yun is sad and sad, and Bi Jing is envious of Chong Rong. The mournful shape is still in service, and the desolation is unbelievable. Hang Jing to cross the road, leaning on the sword in the short pavilion. Always be a special guest, and live an old man forever. The bones of mutual sorrow can be exchanged, and the breeze can also be sent to control."

现实,杜甫,八哀诗 其五 赠秘书监江夏李公邕,唐,长啸宇宙间，高才日陵替。古人不可见，前辈复谁继。忆昔李公存，词林有根柢。声华当健笔，洒落富清制。风流散金石，追琢山岳锐。情穷造化理，学贯天人际。干谒走其门，碑版照四裔。各满深望还，森然起凡例。萧萧白杨路，洞彻宝珠惠。龙宫塔庙涌，浩劫浮云卫。宗儒俎豆事，故吏去思计。眄睐已皆虚，跋涉曾不泥。向来映当时，岂独劝后世。丰屋珊瑚钩，骐驎织成罽。紫骝随剑几，义取无虚岁。分宅脱骖间，感激怀未济。众归赒给美，摆落多藏秽。独步四十年，风听九皋唳。呜呼江夏姿，竟掩宣尼袂。往者武后朝，引用多宠嬖。否臧太常议，面折二张势。衰俗凛生风，排荡秋旻霁。忠贞负冤恨，宫阙深旒缀。放逐早联翩，低垂困炎厉。日斜鵩鸟入，魂断苍梧帝。荣枯走不暇，星驾无安税。几分汉廷竹，夙拥文侯彗。终悲洛阳狱，事近小臣敝。祸阶初负谤，易力何深哜。伊昔临淄亭，酒酣托末契。重叙东都别，朝阴改轩砌。论文到崔苏，指尽流水逝。近伏盈川雄，未甘特进丽。是非张相国，相扼一危脆。争名古岂然，键捷歘不闭。例及吾家诗，旷怀埽氛翳。慷慨嗣真作，咨嗟玉山桂。钟律俨高悬，鲲鲸喷迢遰。坡陀青州血，芜没汶阳瘗。哀赠竟萧条，恩波延揭厉。子孙存如线，旧客舟凝滞。君臣尚论兵，将帅接燕蓟。郎吟六公篇，忧来豁蒙蔽。,Reality,Du Fu,"The fifth of the eight mourning poems was donated to Li Gongyong, secretary Jiangxia","In the universe of Chang Xiao, Gao Cai's mausoleum replaces him day by day. The ancients couldn't see it, whoever succeeded the predecessors. Recalling Li Gongcun in the past, Ci Lin has roots. Shenghua should be a strong pen, sprinkled with rich and clear system. The wind disperses gold and stone, chasing and sharpening the mountains. Poor love and good fortune, learning through the world and interpersonal relationship. Gan Ye walked through the door, and the stele took photos of the four descendants. Everyone is full of deep hopes and returns, and they all rise to the common practice. Xiaoxiao Baiyang Road, Dongche Baozhuhui. The Dragon Palace, the Pagoda, and the temple are surging, and the catastrophe is floating in the clouds. Zong Confucianism and Zudou matter, so the officials went to think about it. The gazing is all empty, and the trek has never been muddy. It has always been reflected at that time, but it is not only to persuade future generations. Fengwu coral hooks are woven into 罽. Zi Liu follows the sword, and righteousness takes no time. The house is separated from the stalls, and I am grateful to Huai Weiji. Everyone returns to the beauty, and puts down a lot of hidden filth. For forty years alone, the wind listened to Jiugao. Woohoo Jiang Xiazi actually hides Xuanni's sleeves. In the past, in the Empress Wu Dynasty, many quotations were favored. No Zang is too common to discuss, face to face two pieces of potential. Declining vulgarity creates a wind, and the autumn is turbulent. Loyalty bears grievances, and the palace is deeply buried. The exile is early, and the drooping sleepiness is severe. When the sun slanted and the birds entered, the soul of Emperor Cangwu was broken. There is no time for prosperity and decline, and there is no security tax for stars. A bit of Han Tingzhu, long-standing Wen Houhui. In the end, I feel sad for Luoyang Prison, and the matter is close to the little minister. At the beginning of the calamity, I was slandered, how deep was Yili. In the past, Linzi Pavilion was full of wine and wine. Retelling the farewell to the east, changing the Chaoyin to build a pavilion. When the thesis reaches Cui Su, the point is gone. Near Fu Yingchuanxiong, not Gante Jinli. Right and wrong are Zhang Xiangguo, and each other is fragile. It's not easy to compete for fame and history, but the key is not closed. For example, my family's poems are full of openness and atmosphere. The generosity of the real work, and the sigh of Yushan Gui. The rhythm of the bell hangs high, and the kun and the whale spout. Potuo Qingzhou blood, no Wenyang disease. The benevolence was actually depressed, and En Boyan denounced it. The children and grandchildren are like a thread, and the old passenger boat is stagnant. Monarchs and ministers still talk about soldiers, and generals take over Yan Ji. Lang chanted the Liugong chapter, worrying about being blinded."
现实,杜甫,卜居,唐,归羡辽东鹤，吟同楚执圭。未成游碧海，著处觅丹梯。云障宽江左，春耕破瀼西。桃红客若至，定似昔人迷。,Reality,Du Fu,Dwelling,"Return to envy Liaodong Crane, sing with Chu Zhigui. If you are not successful, you will travel to the blue sea, and look for Danti. The cloud barrier widens the river to the left, and the spring plowing breaks the west. If peach red guests come, they will be like fans of the past."
现实,杜甫,又上后园山脚,唐,昔我游山东，忆戏东岳阳。穷秋立日观，矫首望八荒。朱崖著毫发，碧海吹衣裳。蓐收困用事，玄冥蔚强梁。逝水自朝宗，镇名各其方。平原独憔悴，农力废耕桑。非关风露凋，曾是戍役伤。于时国用富，足以守边疆。朝廷任猛将，远夺戎虏场。到今事反覆，故老泪万行。龟蒙不复见，况乃怀旧乡。肺萎属久战，骨出热中肠。忧来杖匣剑，更上林北冈。瘴毒猿鸟落，峡乾南日黄。秋风亦已起，江汉始如汤。登高欲有往，荡析川无梁。哀彼远征人，去家死路旁。不及祖父茔，累累冢相当。,Reality,Du Fu,Back to the foot of the mountain,"In the past, I traveled to Shandong and recalled playing in Dongyueyang. Look at the sun in the poor autumn, and look forward to the eight wastes. Zhu Ya has no hair, and the blue sea blows her clothes. If you are struggling with things, Xuan Mingwei is strong. The passing water is from Chaozong, and the towns have their own names. The plain is alone and haggard, and the agricultural power is useless to plow the mulberry. It's not Guan Fenglu withering, it was once a garrison injury. At that time, the country was rich enough to guard the frontier. The imperial court served as a fierce general, seizing the captive field far away. So far, things have been repeated, so I cry all the time. Guimeng is no longer seen, and the situation is nostalgic for the old hometown. Lung atrophy is a long-term battle, and the bones are hot in the middle intestine. Worried about the stick and the sword, go up to Lin Beigang. Miasma and poisonous apes and birds fall, and the south of the gorge is yellow. The autumn wind has also risen, and Jianghan is like soup. Climb high and want to go, but there is no beam in the river. Aibi went on an expedition, went home and died by the roadside. Not as good as my grandfather's tomb, but quite a lot of tombs."
现实,杜甫,又观打鱼,唐,苍江鱼子清晨集，设网提纲万鱼急。能者操舟疾若风，撑突波涛挺叉入。小鱼脱漏不可记，半死半生犹戢戢。大鱼伤损皆垂头，屈强泥沙有时立。东津观鱼已再来，主人罢鲙还倾杯。日暮蛟龙改窟穴，山根鳣鲔随云雷。干戈兵革斗未止，凤凰麒麟安在哉？吾徒胡为纵此乐，暴殄天物圣所哀。,Reality,Du Fu,watch fishing again,"Cangjiang fish roe gathers in the early morning, setting up a net to outline ten thousand fish in a hurry. Those who are able can maneuver the boat as fast as the wind, propping up the surging waves and straightening the fork. A small fish can't be forgotten, half dead and half alive. When the big fish are injured, they bow their heads, and when the strong silt sometimes stands upright. Dongjin Guanyu has come again, and the master pours a cup after stopping the carp. At dusk, the dragons change their caves, and the mountain roots and tuna follow the clouds and thunder. The fighting is still going on, where is the Phoenix and Qilin? My apprentice Hu mourns for indulging in this joy and tyrannizing the sanctuary."
现实,杜甫,万丈潭,唐,青溪合冥莫，神物有显晦。龙依积水蟠，窟压万丈内。局步凌垠堮，侧身下烟霭。前临洪涛宽，却立苍石大。山色一径尽，崖绝两壁对。削成根虚无，倒影垂澹瀩。黑如湾澴底，清见光炯碎。孤云倒来深，飞鸟不在外。高萝成帷幄，寒木累旌旆。远川曲通流，嵌窦潜泄濑。造幽无人境，发兴自我辈。告归遗恨多，将老斯游最。闭藏修鳞蛰，出入巨石碍。何事暑天过，快意风雨会。,Reality,Du Fu,Wanzhangtan,"Qingxi Hemingmo, the fetishes are obscure. The dragon rests on a pan of accumulated water, and the cave is tens of thousands of feet deep. The round step is Ling Yin, and the mist is falling sideways. In front of the Hong Tao is wide, but the stone is big. The mountains are all the way to the end, and the cliffs are facing each other. Peel into nothingness, and the reflection hangs down. It's as black as the bottom of a bay, clear and shattered by light. The lone cloud pours deep, and the birds are not outside. The high radish forms a tent, and the cold trees are tired. Yuanchuan Qutong flow, embedded sinus potential Xie Seto. Create a secluded and uninhabited world, and develop your own generation. I have a lot of grudges, and I will travel the most to Lao Si. Closing Tibet and repairing scales and stings, getting in and out of boulders is an obstacle. What's the matter of the summer, the wind and rain will be happy."
现实,杜甫,丈人山,唐,自为青城客，不唾青城地。为爱丈人山，丹梯近幽意。丈人祠西佳气浓，缘云拟住最高峰。埽除白发黄精在，君看他时冰雪容。,Reality,Du Fu,zhangren mountain,"As a guest of Qingcheng, I don't spit on Qingcheng. For Ai Zhangren Mountain, Dan Ti is close to Youyi. The Zhangren’s Temple is very beautiful in the west, and Yuanyun intends to live on the highest peak. In addition to the white hair, Huang Jing is there, and when you look at him, your face is ice and snow."
现实,杜甫,三川观水涨二十韵,唐,我经华原来，不复见平陆。北上唯土山，连山走穷谷。火云无时出，飞电常在目。自多穷岫雨，行潦相豗蹙。蓊匌川气黄，群流会空曲。清晨望高浪，忽谓阴崖踣。恐泥窜蛟龙，登危聚麋鹿。枯查卷拔树，礧磈共充塞。声吹鬼神下，势阅人代速。不有万穴归，何以尊四渎。及观泉源涨，反惧江海覆。漂沙坼岸去，漱壑松柏秃。乘陵破山门，回斡裂地轴。交洛赴洪河，及关岂信宿。应沈数州没，如听万室哭。秽浊殊未清，风涛怒犹蓄。何时通舟车，阴气不黪黩。浮生有荡汨，吾道正羁束。人寰难容身，石壁滑侧足。云雷此不已，艰险路更局。普天无川梁，欲济愿水缩。因悲中林士，未脱众鱼腹。举头向苍天，安得骑鸿鹄。,Reality,Du Fu,Sanchuan Guanshui Rising Twenty Rhymes,"went through Huayuan and never saw Pinglu again. Go north to Weitu Mountain, and walk through the poor valley through the mountains. Fire clouds come out from time to time, and flying electricity is always in sight. Since there are so many poor and poor Xiuyu, the lines are scattered and squatting. The air in the Fenggao River is yellow, and the crowds will be empty. Looking at the high waves in the early morning, it is suddenly called a cloudy cliff. Fearing that the mud will run into the dragon, and the elk will gather in danger. The dry checks and the trees are pulled out, and the piles are full. The sound blows ghosts and gods, and the potential reads the speed of others. If there are no thousands of points to return to, why respect the four blasphemy. And watch the source rise, and fear the river and the sea. Drift the sand and go to the shore, and rinse the valley with pine and cypresses. Chengling broke the mountain gate, and returned to split the axis of the earth. Jiaoluo went to Honghe, and Guanqi Xinsu. Ying Shen several states are gone, such as listening to thousands of rooms crying. The filth and turbidity are still unclear, and the wind and waves are still raging. When the boat and car pass through, the yin energy will not fade away. There are turmoil in the floating life, and my way is restrained. It's hard to stand in the world, and the stone wall is slippery. Yun Lei is endless, and the difficult and dangerous road is changing. There are no rivers and bridges in the world, and if you want to help, you are willing to shrink. Because of the grief of Lin Shi, he did not get rid of the belly of the fish. Raising his head to the sky, An De rides on a swan."

How clumsy it is to rub and pedal, and the head is not safe. Traveling all over the world, childish daily life. But when you meet new teenagers, you seldom meet old relatives and friends. Low-spirited, the old man knows how to seduce. The younger generation is full of blood, and his behavior is ugly. Poverty and oppression are often like a stroke. In the first century, it came out of Western Shu, and now it is fighting south. The lone boat is in chaos, and the teeth are in the willows at dusk. In the midst of nine suspicious burials, the bones of the saint will also rot. Wasted Tao Tang people, whipped the sun and the moon for a long time. In the middle, Qu Jia's generation, slandering and slandering themselves. Yu did not have two sad souls, but the depression is still there. The Qingxiang stone is in the Qing Dynasty, and the retrograde miscellaneous forests and bushes. The pole's work is dense and skillful, and the spirit is like a glass of wine. Praise each other and inspire each other, and return to Wuming to be taught. Good knowledge should touch the category, each borrowing wisdom to let go. Since ancient times, economic talents are rare. All the colors are dark, and the bear hangs and the snake roars. Huang Wei is on the top of the tree, guarding for the tigers. How suitable will the body be, and the face will be thicker. The common people and the masters talk about it, swallowing their voices and mixing them with dirt."

Xiaoyuan carries Takaoka on his back, and Ge Shangzaki Yin on his back. The open view extends to the eyes, and the lapel is scattered and scattered. The potential scale hates the water and is strong, and the wings are deep. Don't say that the land has no boundaries, it is inferior to the mountains with shade. Stones are all over the world, both water and land are floating and sinking. I ascended Longshou by myself, and passed through Bicen for ten years. Jianmen came to Wu Gorge, and Bo Yihao has been there ever since. The hometown is dark with soldiers and horses, and the flesh and blood are lost. There is no news in times of danger, and when you get old, you will return to your heart. People with lofty ideals cherish the day, and long-term customers borrow gold. Dare to scream for Sumen, and sing for Liang's father."

How late General Ruitou came, made me feel miserable. Look at the yellow fog and the mysterious clouds, and listen to the severe wind breaking the trees. The source of the spring is cold and miscellaneous apes, muddy and hungry. At the end of the year, the poverty and darkness are endless, and it is hard to meet again in life. Yi Er puts a wire arrow down her waist and shoots the snow-coloured deer in the forest. The former sits on the skin and asks Mao, and Zhizi's adventures are difficult. Strange beasts fall like flying stars, responding to strings without hindering the height of Cangshan Mountain. An Detu rides only five thousand horses, but his brows and bones are all cao. Going out of the chaotic world is urged, and once enlightened, the Lord is in the dark. Recalling that in the past, Fan Zeng's broken jade bucket did not make Wu soldiers wear white robes. In the dark, the atmosphere is closed, and the thunder in Jingnan is howling in October."

The white snake climbed into its nest and devoured the king's meal. The male flies far away begging for food, while the female sings bitterly.

Sri Lanka must lead the falcon, and send the announcement in pain and indignation. The lonely shadow on the bucket, roaring for nine days. Repair the scales and remove the distant branches, the old boxing of the giant mantle. The sky has to rub against the pedal, and the short grass is winding. The folded tail can be dropped, and the full intestines have been worn out. Although life destroys the young, death also lasts for a thousand years. There is revenge in things, and happiness is expensive at present. It is true that the bird of prey is the most, and the heart is full of anxiety and difficulty. If the success is lost, He Qixian will be used. Recently, it has been said by the Lushuimei that the woodcutter passed on this matter. Fluttering Xiaojue Sufa, Lin wants to rush to the crown of Confucianism. Promises and divisions in life are only between looking forward to. Chatting for righteousness, use to stimulate the liver of strong men."

There were no pedestrians for three days, and Erjiang howled angrily. Liqing is in the evil city, and Jianggao is far away. Stepping storks and cranes in the barren courtyard, looking at the waves in secret. Shen Yan gathers medicine bait, and suddenly forgets what he has done.

The tree feathers are quiet for thousands of miles, and Linjiang has returned for a long time. The mountain monk's clothes are blue and tell Dongliang to destroy.

The stack of clouds and blue is dry and steep, and the structure of the ladder stone is firm. There are sparse forests in thousands of valleys, and the accumulated shade brings rushing waves. The cold sun is calm outside, and the long wind howls angrily. Resting the saddle on the ground, I began to feel the height of the calendar. Sitting and lying down, people and horses are all tired.

Danqing doesn't know the old man will come, wealth and honor are like floating clouds to me. It is often introduced in Kaiyuan, and the number of Chengen goes to Nanxun Hall. Ling Yan's hero has little color, and the general's writing is fresh. A good minister puts a virtuous crown on his head, and slams a big feathered arrow at his waist. Bao Gong and E Gong Mao mobilized, heroic and brave to fight fiercely. The first emperor Tianma Yuhuacong, the painters are as different as the mountains. It's the day when the Chichi is brought down, and the wind grows in the distance. The edict said that the general brushed the silk, meaning that the craftsman was in dismal business. Si Xu's nine-fold real dragon came out, washing away the emptiness of all the mortal horses of all ages. But Yuhua is on the imperial couch, standing facing each other in front of the court. The supreme being smiled and urged to give the gold, and all the servants and servants of Yu were melancholy. Disciple Han Gan entered the room early, and he was also able to draw horses and horses. Gan only paints the flesh but not the bones, forbearance makes Hualiu's spirit wither. The general's painting is good and full of spirit, and he must also paint pictures when he meets a good scholar. Today, in the midst of wandering and fighting, there are many ordinary passers-by. If you are poor on the road, you will be blinded by vulgar eyes. There is no such thing as public poverty in the world. But looking at the great reputation in ancient times, he was entangled in ups and downs all day long."

The plank road in Yangling is thin, overlooking the river and trees. The land is secluded and there are no nets, and the water is clear, but there are many fish. Good birds do not fly indiscriminately, but savages live in half-nests. Happy to see simplicity and vulgarity, calm and comfortable. The eastern suburbs are still fighting, when will the cunning be eliminated. There are younger brothers and sisters in my hometown, who live in Suiqiuxu. Everything is going well in Chengdu, why not return to my cottage."
现实,杜甫,今夕行,唐,今夕何夕岁云徂，更长烛明不可孤。咸阳客舍一事无，相与博塞为欢娱。冯陵大叫呼五白，袒跣不肯成枭卢。英雄有时亦如此，邂逅岂即非良图。君莫笑刘毅从来布衣愿，家无儋石输百万。,Reality,Du Fu,tonight,"Tonight, He Xi, Sui Yun, and the longer candlelight, you can't be alone. There is nothing in the Xianyang guest house, and they are happy with Bosser. Feng Ling yelled at Wubai, and refused to become Xiaolu with his bare back. The same is sometimes true of heroes, and encounters are not good plans. Jun Moxiao Liu Yi has always been a commoner, and his family has no stones to lose millions."
现实,杜甫,凤凰台,唐,亭亭凤凰台，北对西康州。西伯今寂寞，凰声亦悠悠。山峻路绝踪，石林气高浮。安得万丈梯，为君上上头。恐有无母雏，饥寒日啾啾。我能剖心出，饮啄慰孤愁。心以当竹实，炯然无外求。血以当醴泉，岂徒比清流。所贵王者瑞，敢辞微命休。坐看綵翮长，举意八极周。自天衔瑞图，飞下十二楼。图以奉至尊，凤以垂鸿猷。再光中兴业，一洗苍生忧。深衷正为此，群盗何淹留。,Reality,Du Fu,Phoenix Terrace,"The pavilion is Phoenix Terrace, facing Xikangzhou in the north. Xibo is lonely today, and the sound of the phoenix is also long. There is no trace of mountain roads, and the atmosphere of stone forests is high. And the ten thousand-foot ladder, for the king to go up to the top. Fearing whether there will be mothers or young, chirping on hungry and cold days. I can cut my heart out and drink to comfort my loneliness. The heart is like a bamboo, and there is nothing else to look for. When blood is used as a sweet spring, it is nothing more than a clear stream. The noble king, Rui, dares to resign from his life. Sit and watch Caihe grow up, and raise your intentions to the eight poles. From the title of Ruitu in the sky, fly down the twelfth floor. The picture is used to worship the supreme, and the phoenix is used to hang down the Hongyou. Let the Zhongxing industry shine again, and the worries of the common people will be washed away. Sincerely because of this, the bandits He Yan stayed."
现实,杜甫,天边行,唐,天边老人归未得，日暮东临大江哭。陇右河源不种田，胡骑羌兵入巴蜀。洪涛滔天风拔木，前飞秃鹙后鸿鹄。九度附书向洛阳，十年骨肉无消息。,Reality,Du Fu,Skyline,"The old man at the end of the sky has not yet returned, and at dusk the east faces the great river and cries. There was no farming at the source of the Longyou River, and Hu Qi and Qiang soldiers entered Bashu. The torrential wind pulls out the trees, and the bald bird flies forward and the swan is behind. Nine degrees attached a letter to Luoyang, and there was no news of the flesh and blood for ten years."
现实,杜甫,天育骠骑歌,唐,吾闻天子之马走千里，今之画图无乃是。是何意态雄且杰，骏尾萧梢朔风起。毛为绿缥两耳黄，眼有紫燄双瞳方。矫矫龙性合变化，卓立天骨森开张。伊昔太仆张景顺，监牧攻驹阅清峻。遂令大奴守天育，别养骥子怜神俊。当时四十万匹马，张公叹其材尽下。故独写真传世人，见之座右久更新。年多物化空形影，呜呼健步无由骋。如今岂无騕袅与骅骝，时无王良伯乐死即休。,Reality,Du Fu,Tianyu Hussar's Song,"have heard that the emperor's horse travels thousands of miles, but today's drawing is nothing like it. He Yi is majestic and outstanding, and the wind rises from the tail of the horse. The hair is green and the ears are yellow, and the eyes have purple flames. The sex of the orthodontist changed, and Zhuo Li Tiangu Sen opened. In the past, Zhang Jingshun, the eunuch of Yixi, supervised the pastor and attacked the foal to read Qingjun. So he ordered the big slave to guard the heavenly education, not to raise his son and pity the handsome man. At that time, there were 400,000 horses, and Mr. Zhang lamented that they were exhausted. Therefore, the only photo is handed down to the world, and the seat of seeing it will be renewed for a long time. For more than a year, it has become empty and shadowy, and there is no way to walk vigorously. How can there be no Yanyou and Hualiu now, and there is no Wang Liangbo who will rest when he dies."
现实,杜甫,太子张舍人遗织成褥段,唐,客从西北来，遗我翠织成。开缄风涛涌，中有掉尾鲸。逶迤罗水族，琐细不足名。客云充君褥，承君终宴荣。空堂魑魅走，高枕形神清。领客珍重意，顾我非公卿。留之惧不祥，施之混柴荆。服饰定尊卑，大哉万古程。今我一贱老，裋褐更无营。煌煌珠宫物，寝处祸所婴。叹息当路子，干戈尚纵横。掌握有权柄，衣马自肥轻。李鼎死岐阳，实以骄贵盈。来瑱赐自尽，气豪直阻兵。皆闻黄金多，坐见悔吝生。奈何田舍翁，受此厚贶情。锦鲸卷还客，始觉心和平。振我粗席尘，愧客茹藜羹。,Reality,Du Fu,Prince Zhang Sheren left behind weaving mattresses,"The guest came from the northwest, and left me to weave it. Kaiji winds and waves are surging, and there are tailed whales in it. The meandering aquarium is not trivial. The guest cloud fills the king's mattress, and the king inherits the final banquet. The empty hall is full of charms, and the spirit is refreshed. Leading customers cherish their intentions, and I am not a public servant. Keep it for fear of ominousness, and give it to mix firewood and thorns. Clothes determine the dignity and inferiority, which is a long way through the ages. Now I'm a cheap old man, and I'm even more helpless. Brilliant and bright pearls are palace objects, and the sleeping place is a disaster for the baby. Sighing is the way to go, and Ge Shang is vertical and horizontal. With authority, clothes and horses are self-fat and light. When Li Ding died in Qiyang, he was filled with arrogance. Lai Zhenci committed suicide, and he was so arrogant that he blocked the soldiers. Everyone has heard that there is a lot of gold, but when they see it, they regret it. However, Weng Tianshe received such kindness. The brocade whale rolls back to the guest, and I feel peace of mind. Vibrate my rough mat dust, shame the guest Ru Cheno soup."

The dry willow roots come out of the spring, attracting the old age. The eyes of the sea can be seen between the stones, and the water mansion is lingering on the bank of the sky. Between the wide and the deep, the feast dares to be insulted. The two little snakes, blue and white, have a graceful appearance that can be seen from time to time. Like silk air or up, rotten rice is cloud and rain. From the top of the mountain to the bottom of the mountain, the wells are not exhausted. Take it and offer it to the monks of the ten directions, the fragrance is better than milk. The north wind blows cold, and the weak algae shroud green strands. Ming Han's guest clothes are clean, and the shadows of the forest are fine. He Dang's house is dirty, and Yu Runtong medicine garden. Three spring damp sealwort, one food raw hairiness."

The servant of Yun'an Gushui is sad, and Yufu moves to save his heart. In the west of Baidi City, there are thousands of bamboo pans, and the water pipes are not dry. It is difficult to stay in life, and it is difficult to fight against water."
现实,杜甫,忆昔二首 其一,唐,忆昔先皇巡朔方，千乘万骑入咸阳。阴山骄子汗血马，长驱东胡胡走藏。邺城反覆不足怪，关中小儿坏纪纲，张后不乐上为忙。至今今上犹拨乱，劳身焦思补四方。我昔近侍叨奉引，出兵整肃不可当。为留猛士守未央，致使岐雍防西羌。犬戎直来坐御床，百官跣足随天王。愿见北地傅介子，老儒不用尚书郎。,Reality,Du Fu,"Memories of the past, one of two","Recalling that the former emperor visited Shuofang and rode thousands of horses into Xianyang. The proud son of the Yin Mountain, a bloody horse, drove east and west to hide. It's not surprising that Yecheng repeated itself. The children in Guanzhong were bad at Ji Gang, and Empress Zhang was not happy to be busy. Up to now, it is still chaotic, and it is hard to make up for the Quartet. In the past, I used to be a servant and a servant, and it was unacceptable to send troops to clean up. In order to keep the warriors guarding Weiyang, Qiyong defended against Xiqiang. Quan Rong came straight to sit on the imperial bed, and all the officials followed the king with their feet. I would like to see Fu Jiezi in the north, and the old Confucian does not need Shang Shulang."

The rice is fat and the corn is white, and the public and private warehouses are full of fruit. There are no jackals and tigers on the roads of Kyushu, and the sunrise will not be auspicious when traveling far. Qiwan, Luxuan, and the trains are in frequent shifts, and men and women who farm and mulberry do not lose each other. The sages in the palace played Cloud Gate, and friends all over the world were glued to each other. There has been no catastrophe for more than a hundred years, and the rituals and music of uncles and grandchildren are Xiao Helu. Unexpectedly, a piece of silk is worth tens of thousands of dollars, and there are fields and valleys that are bleeding now. The Luoyang palace was burned to the ground, and the ancestral temple was newly removed from the fox and rabbit dens. I am so sad that I can't bear to ask the elders, and I am afraid that I will talk about the chaos at the beginning. The little minister is dull and incompetent, and the imperial court remembers Meng Luzhi. Zhou Xuanzhong hoped for my emperor, and Jiang Han was debilitated and ill."

Hard work doesn't see Mr. Hua Gai, is Gen Cen Qinghui miserable? There is no one on the thousand cliffs, and the valley is quiet. Take three steps to look back and sit on five steps. Qiu Shan's eyes are cold and his soul has not returned, and the immortals are delighted and tearful. Who of the disciples is in the white thatched room, and Mr. Lu alone opens the bronze lock. Brush the incense with the towel and pound the medicine dust to remove the ashes and burn the red fire. Cangzhou is vast and empty in the hanging garden, and the feathers and clothes are fluttering gracefully in the golden festival. The setting sun and the early glow are shining, and there is nothing wrong with sudden things. When the sound of the pine wind and the stream is in harmony, the green scorpion and the yellow bear cry to me. It is in vain to consult and caress the relics, and the dream is still lingering. The secret hidden text must be taught internally, and He Gong will make the wish come true in his later years. Let's discuss Dong Lianshi in Hengyang, and Nanfu drums in Xiaoxiang early."

What are the neighbors, one or two old widows. The old bird loves its own branch, and it is peaceful and poor. Fang Chun hoes the lotus alone, and at dusk he also irrigates the furrows. The county officials knew I was coming and ordered to practice drums. Although he served in this state, he had nothing to carry inside. Go near and stop, go far and end up lost. The hometown is full of turmoil, and the principles of distance and distance are also in harmony. Always suffering from a long-term sick mother, Weigouxi for five years.

Only then did I know that there are no other mountains besides the Five Sacred Mountains. Yang Qiansai Daming, leaning into the crack Houkun. Hearing tigers and leopards fight again, repeated feng shui faints. There is an abandoned pavilion on the top, which is broken like a short shaft. There is a holly forest below, and long roots walk on the stone. Xiya has beautiful hair, glowing like ganoderma lucidum. Moisturizing gold and jade, clear and free of sand and soil traces.

现实,杜甫,韦讽录事宅观曹将军画马图,唐,国初已来画鞍马，神妙独数江都王。将军得名三十载，人间又见真乘黄。曾貌先帝照夜白，龙池十日飞霹雳。内府殷红马脑盌，倢伃传诏才人索。盌赐将军拜舞归，轻纨细绮相追飞。贵戚权门得笔迹，始觉屏障生光辉。昔日太宗拳毛騧，近时郭家师子花。今之新图有二马，复令识者久叹嗟。此皆骑战一敌万，缟素漠漠开风沙。其馀七匹亦殊绝，迥若寒空动烟雪。霜蹄蹴踏长楸间，马官厮养森成列。可怜九马争神骏，顾视清高气深稳。借问苦心爱者谁，后有韦讽前支遁。忆昔巡幸新丰宫，翠华拂天来向东。腾骧磊落三万匹，皆与此图筋骨同。自从献宝朝河宗，无复射蛟江水中。君不见金粟堆前松柏里，龙媒去尽鸟呼风。,Reality,Du Fu,Wei satirizes Shi Zhai to observe General Cao's painting of horses,"At the beginning of the country, he came to paint pommel horses, and the only one who is wonderful is the king of Jiangdu. The general has been named for 30 years, and the real Chenghuang is seen again in the world. Emperor Zeng Maung shines at night and white, and Longchi flies thunderbolt in ten days. The Yinhong horse brain bowl in the inner government is passed on to the talented people. The bowl is given to the general to worship and dance back, and the light and fine Qi chases each other. When the noble relatives got the handwriting, they began to feel that the barrier was shining. In the old days, Taizong boxed Mao Mao, but recently, the Guo family's master Zihua. Today's new picture has two horses, which will make those who know it sigh for a long time. These are all riding battles with one enemy ten thousand, and the desert is deserted by wind and sand. The other seven horses are also unique, like smoke and snow moving in the cold sky. Frost hooves step across the long catalpa, and horse officials support the forest in a row. Poor nine horses vying for the gods, Gu Shiqing is high-spirited and steady. If you ask who the sweetheart is, there will be Wei Xie who flees before. Recalling the past visits to Xinfeng Palace, Cuihua came to the east. Teng Xiang's 30,000 horses are all the same muscles and bones as this picture. Since Xianbao went to Hezong, there has been no shooting in Jiaojiang water again. Don't you see that in the pines and cypresses in front of the golden millet pile, the dragon media went to exhaust the birds and blow the wind."
现实,杜甫,风雨看舟前落花戏为新句,唐,江上人家桃树枝，春寒细雨出疏篱。影遭碧水潜勾引，风妒红花却倒吹。吹花困癫傍舟楫，水光风力俱相怯。赤憎轻薄遮入怀，珍重分明不来接。湿久飞迟半日高，萦沙惹草细于毛。蜜蜂蝴蝶生情性，偷眼蜻蜓避百劳。,Reality,Du Fu,Watching the boat in front of the storm and falling flowers play is a new sentence,"On the river, there are peach branches from people's houses, and the spring cold and drizzle come out of the fence. The shadow is seduced by the blue water dive, but the wind is jealous of the red flower but blows backwards. Blowing flowers, sleepiness, and boats, the water, the light, and the wind are all timid. The red hates the frivolity and hides it in the bosom, but it is clear that the treasure will not come to pick it up. Wet for a long time and fly late for half a day, the lingering sandy grass is thinner than the hair. Bees and butterflies are emotional, stealing dragonflies avoid labor."
现实,杜甫,乐游园歌,唐,乐游古园崒森爽，烟绵碧草萋萋长。公子华筵势最高，秦川对酒平如掌。长生木瓢示真率，更调鞍马狂欢赏。青春波浪芙蓉园，白日雷霆夹城仗。阊阖晴开昳荡荡，曲江翠幕排银榜。拂水低徊舞袖翻，缘云清切歌声上。却忆年年人醉时，只今未醉已先悲。数茎白发那抛得，百罚深杯亦不辞。圣朝亦知贱士丑，一物自荷皇天慈。此身饮罢无归处，独立苍茫自咏诗。,Reality,Du Fu,Happy Garden Song,"The ancient garden of Leyou is dense and cool, with smoky green grass and luxuriant growth. Young Master Hua has the highest banquet, and Qin Chuan treats wine like palm. The long-lived wooden ladle shows the truth, and the pommel horse is replaced for a carnival reward. In the Hibiscus Garden of youthful waves, thunder and thunder fight in the daytime. When the sun is shining and the weather is clear, the Qujiang Cuimu ranks on the silver list. Whisk the water low and dance the sleeves up, and the singing of Yuanyun is clear. But I recall that when people are drunk every year, they are sad before they are drunk. If you throw away a few stems of white hair, you will not hesitate to pay a hundred fines and a deep cup. The Holy Dynasty also knew that lowly people were ugly, and everything came from the kindness of the lotus emperor. This body has no place to return to after drinking, and sings poems independently and boundlessly."
现实,杜甫,写怀二首 其一,唐,劳生共乾坤，何处异风俗。冉冉自趋竞，行行见羁束。无贵贱不悲，无富贫亦足。万古一骸骨，邻家递歌哭。鄙夫到巫峡，三岁如转烛。全命甘留滞，忘情任荣辱。朝班及暮齿，日给还脱粟。编蓬石城东，采药山北谷。用心霜雪间，不必条蔓绿。非关故安排，曾是顺幽独。达士如弦直，小人似钩曲。曲直我不知，负暄候樵牧。,Reality,Du Fu,Write one of two poems,"Labor and birth share the universe, where customs are different. Slowly rushing to compete, seeing what you do. No high or low is not sad, no rich or poor is enough. The bones of the ages, the neighbors sing and cry. My husband went to Wuxia, and he was like a candle at the age of three. Willing to stay in the whole life, forgetting the honor and disgrace. Morning class and evening teeth, the daily supply is returned to millet. In the east of Pengshi City, there is the North Valley of the Herb Picking Mountain. In the frost and snow with your heart, you don't have to be green. It was not arranged by Guan, it was Shunyoudu. Dashi is straight like a string, and a villain is like a hook. I don't know the straight and the straight, I'm waiting for the woodcutter and animal husbandry."
现实,杜甫,写怀二首 其二,唐,夜深坐南轩，明月照我膝。惊风翻河汉，梁栋已出日。群生各一宿，飞动自俦匹。吾亦驱其儿，营营为私实。天寒行旅稀，岁暮日月疾。荣名忽中人，世乱如虮虱。古者三皇前，满腹志愿毕。胡为有结绳，陷此胶与漆。祸首燧人氏，厉阶董狐笔。君看灯烛张，转使飞蛾密。放神八极外，俯仰俱萧瑟。终契如往还，得匪合仙术。,Reality,Du Fu,write two poems,"Sitting in Nanxuan late at night, the bright moon shines on my knees. The startled wind turned the river, and Liang Dong had already risen. The group of living beings each have one night, flying from their spouses. I also drive away my son, and the camp is private. The weather is cold and the travel is rare, and the sun and the moon are sick at the end of the year. The honor and fame are suddenly in the middle, and the world is chaotic like gnats. Before the Three Emperors of the ancients, he was full of volunteers. Because of the knotted rope, Hu got stuck in the glue and lacquer. The culprit is Suiren's family, Li Jie Dong Hubi. You look at the lamps and candles, and the moths are dense. Let your mind go beyond the eight extremes, and look up and down are bleak. In the end, the contract is as before, and you will get the bandit magic."
现实,杜甫,冬到金华山观因得故拾遗陈公学堂遗迹,唐,涪右众山内，金华紫崔嵬。上有蔚蓝天，垂光抱琼台。系舟接绝壁，杖策穷萦回。四顾俯层巅，澹然川谷开。雪岭日色死，霜鸿有馀哀。焚香玉女跪，雾里仙人来。陈公读书堂，石柱仄青苔。悲风为我起，激烈伤雄才。,Reality,Du Fu,Visiting Jinhua Mountain in winter to view the relics of Chen Gong School,"In the mountains on the right side of Fu, Jinhua Zi Cuiwei. There is a blue sky above, and the hanging light embraces Qiongtai. The boat is tied to the cliff, and the stick policy lingers back. Looking around the top of the floor, the rivers and valleys open calmly. The sun is dying in Xueling, and Shuanghong is sad. The jade girl who burns incense kneels, and the fairy in the fog comes. Chen Gong's reading hall, with stone pillars and moss. The sad wind blows up for me, and it hurts the talents fiercely."
现实,杜甫,冬狩行,唐,君不见东川节度兵马雄，校猎亦似观成功。夜发猛士三千人，清晨合围步骤同。禽兽已毙十七八，杀声落日回苍穹。幕前生致九青兕，骆驼?峞垂玄熊。东西南北百里间，髣髴蹴踏寒山空。有鸟名鸲鹆，力不能高飞逐走蓬。肉味不足登鼎俎，何为见羁虞罗中。春蒐冬狩侯得同，使君五马一马骢。况今摄行大将权，号令颇有前贤风。飘然时危一老翁，十年厌见旌旗红。喜君士卒甚整肃，为我回辔擒西戎。草中狐兔尽何益，天子不在咸阳宫。朝廷虽无幽王祸，得不哀痛尘再蒙。呜呼，得不哀痛尘再蒙。,Reality,Du Fu,winter hunting trip,"Don't you see Dongchuan Jiedu Bing Maxiong, and the school hunting seems to be successful. Three thousand warriors were sent out at night, and the encirclement steps were the same in the early morning. The beasts have been killed for seventeen or eighteen, and the sound of killing falls back to the sky. In front of the curtain, there are nine green scorpions, camels? Chui Xuanxiong. The distance between east, west, north, south and hundreds of miles is like stepping on the cold mountains and empty space. There is a bird named robin, unable to fly high enough to chase away the canopy. The taste of the meat is not enough to ascend the tripod, so what is the purpose of seeing Yu Luozhong. Searching in spring and hunting in winter, the marquis get the same, so that the king has five horses and one horse. In addition, today, the power of the general is taken, and the orders are quite virtuous. There is an old man who is in danger when he is floating, and he has hated seeing red flags for ten years. Xijun's soldiers were very clean-up, and they returned to the bridle to capture Xirong for me. What is the benefit of the fox and rabbit in the grass? The emperor is not in Xianyang Palace. Although there is no misfortune for King You in the imperial court, it must not be mourned again. Woohoo, I have to mourn and dust again."
现实,杜甫,北风,唐,北风破南极，朱凤日威垂。洞庭秋欲雪，鸿雁将安归。十年杀气盛，六合人烟稀。吾慕汉初老，时清犹茹芝。,Reality,Du Fu,north wind,"The north wind breaks through the Antarctic, and Zhufeng's majesty hangs down. Dongting is about to snow in autumn, and the swan geese will return home safely. Ten years have been full of murderous aura, and Liuhe is sparsely populated. I admire the old age in the early Han Dynasty, but it is still Ru Zhi in the Qing Dynasty."
现实,杜甫,北征,唐,皇帝二载秋，闰八月初吉。杜子将北征，苍茫问家室。维时遭艰虞，朝野少暇日。顾惭恩私被，诏许归蓬荜。拜辞诣阙下，怵惕久未出。虽乏谏诤姿，恐君有遗失。君诚中兴主，经纬固密勿。东胡反未已，臣甫愤所切。挥涕恋行在，道途犹恍惚。乾坤含疮痍，忧虞何时毕。靡靡踰阡陌，人烟眇萧瑟。所遇多被伤，呻吟更流血。回首凤翔县，旌旗晚明灭。前登寒山重，屡得饮马窟。邠郊入地底，泾水中荡潏。猛虎立我前，苍崖吼时裂。菊垂今秋花，石戴古车辙。青云动高兴，幽事亦可悦。山果多琐细，罗生杂橡栗。或红如丹砂，或黑如点漆。雨露之所濡，甘苦齐结实。缅思桃源内，益叹身世拙。坡陀望鄜畤，岩谷互出没。我行已水滨，我仆犹木末。鸱鸟鸣黄桑，野鼠拱乱穴。夜深经战场，寒月照白骨。潼关百万师，往者散何卒。遂令半秦民，残害为异物。况我堕胡尘，及归尽华发。经年至茅屋，妻子衣百结。恸哭松声回，悲泉共幽咽。平生所娇儿，颜色白胜雪。见耶背面啼，垢腻脚不袜。床前两小女，补绽才过膝。海图坼波涛，旧绣移曲折。天吴及紫凤，颠倒在裋褐。老夫情怀恶，呕泄卧数日。那无囊中帛，救汝寒凛慄。粉黛亦解苞，衾裯稍罗列。瘦妻面复光，痴女头自栉。学母无不为，晓妆随手抹。移时施朱铅，狼藉画眉阔。生还对童稚，似欲忘饥渴。问事竞挽须，谁能即嗔喝。翻思在贼愁，甘受杂乱聒。新归且慰意，生理焉能说。至尊尚蒙尘，几日休练卒。仰观天色改，坐觉祅气豁。阴风西北来，惨澹随回鹘。其王愿助顺，其俗善驰突。送兵五千人，驱马一万匹。此辈少为贵，四方服勇决。所用皆鹰腾，破敌过箭疾。圣心颇虚伫，时议气欲夺。伊洛指掌收，西京不足拔。官军请深入，蓄锐何俱发。此举开青徐，旋瞻略恒碣。昊天积霜露，正气有肃杀。祸转亡胡岁，势成擒胡月。胡命其能久，皇纲未宜绝。忆昨狼狈初，事与古先别。奸臣竟菹醢，同恶随荡析。不闻夏殷衰，中自诛褒妲。周汉获再兴，宣光果明哲。桓桓陈将军，仗钺奋忠烈。微尔人尽非，于今国犹活。凄凉大同殿，寂寞白兽闼。都人望翠华，佳气向金阙。园陵固有神，埽洒数不缺。煌煌太宗业，树立甚宏达。,Reality,Du Fu,Beizheng,"The emperor's second year is autumn, and it is auspicious in the first month of August. Du Zi will march north, and ask his family in the vastness. Difficulties were encountered in Weishi, and the ruling and opposition parties had little leisure time. Gu Xianen was privately ordered to return to Pengpi. After paying homage to the que, I have not been out of fear for a long time. Although there is a lack of remonstrance and admonition, I am afraid that the king will lose it. You are sincere and rejuvenate the master, and the latitude and longitude are solid and dense. Donghu's rebellion has not stopped, and the minister is angry. Wiping tears and love is walking, the road is still in a trance. The universe is full of scars, worrying about when it will end. The rice fields are overwhelmed, and the people are sparse and desolate. The more you encounter, the more you will be injured, and the more you will bleed when you moan. Looking back at Fengxiang County, the flags and flags were lit and extinguished late. Climbing the cold mountain before is heavy, and I have won the horse cave many times. The suburbs of Bing go underground, and the Jingshui sways. The fierce tiger stands in front of me, and the blue cliff roars and cracks. Chrysanthemums hang down this autumn flowers, and stones wear ancient ruts. Qingyun is happy, and quiet things are also pleasant. The berries are many and thin, and there are mixed acorns and chestnuts. Or red like cinnabar, or black like lacquer. Wet by the rain and dew, the joys and sorrows are solid. Thinking about Taoyuan, I sigh for my humble life experience. Po Tuo looks at the pot, and rocks and valleys haunt each other. My walk has reached the water's edge, and my servant is like the end of a tree. Birds sing yellow mulberries, wild mice dig chaotic holes. Late at night through the battlefield, the cold moon shines on the bones. There are millions of teachers in Tongguan, how can those who go there be scattered? So he ordered the half-Qin people to mutilate them as foreign objects. What's more, I fall into the dust of the beard, and return to the end of my hair. After years of going to the hut, the wife's clothes are knotted. The weeping pines echoed, and the mourning springs swallowed together. The beauty of my life, the color is whiter than snow. See Jesus crying from behind, dirty feet and no socks. The two little girls in front of the bed are just above their knees. The sea chart is full of waves, and the old embroidery moves with twists and turns. Tian Wu and Zi Feng are turned upside down on the ground. The old man felt bad and vomited and lay down for several days. The silk in the bag will save you from the cold and shivering. Fendai is also unbudding, and the quilts are slightly listed. The thin wife's face regains her luster, and the idiot scratches her head. The school mother did everything, and Xiao makeup was wiped off casually. When the time shifts, the red lead is applied, and the thrush is messy. Survival is childish, like wanting to forget hunger and thirst. If you ask something and compete to pull your beard, who can drink immediately. Fansi is worried about thieves, willing to suffer from chaos. New home and comfort, how can physiology be said. The supreme being is still dusty, and he will not practice for a few days. Look up at the sky and change, sit and feel free. The dark wind comes from the northwest, and the bleakness follows the Uighur. Its king is willing to help Shun, and its custom is good at galloping. Send 5,000 soldiers and drive 10,000 horses. In this generation, less is more precious, and the Quartet obeys bravely. All the eagles are used, breaking the enemy faster than the arrow. The Sacred Heart is quite empty, and the spirit of the time is about to be seized. Yiluo is close at the palm of his hand, but Xijing is not enough. Officers and soldiers, please go deep, store up your energy and go all out. This move opened Qingxu, and looked forward to Hengjie. Haotian accumulates frost and dew, and the righteousness is chilling. The disaster turned to Hu Sui, and Hu Yue was captured. Hu Ming can last for a long time, and the emperor's plan should not be cut off. Recalling yesterday's embarrassment at the beginning, let's say goodbye to the past. The treacherous ministers went so far as to succumb to the same evil. If you don't hear of Xia Yin's decline, you will punish yourself and praise Da. Zhou Han was revived, and Xuan Guangguo became wise. General Huanhuan Chen is loyal and fierce with his battle axe. The Weier people are absolutely wrong, and they are still alive in this country. The desolate Great Harmony Hall, the lonely white beast door. People in the capital look at the emerald flowers, and look forward to the golden palace. There are inherent gods in the garden, and there is no shortage of scorpions. Huang Huang Taizong's industry has established a very Hongda."
现实,杜甫,去矣行,唐,君不见韝上鹰，一饱则飞掣。焉能作堂上燕，衔泥附炎热。野人旷荡无腼颜，岂可久在王侯间。未试囊中餐玉法，明朝且入蓝田山。,Reality,Du Fu,Go and go,"Don't you see that the eagle is on the tail, and it will fly when it is full. How can it be a swallow in the hall, with mud in its mouth and heat. The savage is wild and shameless, how can he stay among the princes for a long time. I have not tried the jade method of Chinese food in the bag, and entered Lantian Mountain in the Ming Dynasty."
现实,杜甫,去秋行,唐,去秋涪江木落时，臂枪走马谁家儿。到今不知白骨处，部曲有去皆无归。遂州城中汉节在，遂州城外巴人稀。战场冤魂每夜哭，空令野营猛士悲。,Reality,Du Fu,go for an autumn trip,"When the woods on the Fujiang River fall in autumn, who is going to walk away with a gun? So far I don't know where the bones are, and the trilogy has gone and never returned. The Han Festival is in Suizhou City, but there are few people outside Suizhou City. The innocent souls on the battlefield cry every night, making the camping warriors sad."
现实,杜甫,发刘郎浦,唐,挂帆早发刘郎浦，疾风飒飒昏亭午。舟中无日不沙尘，岸上空村尽豺虎。十日北风风未回，客行岁晚晚相催。白头厌伴渔人宿，黄帽青鞋归去来。,Reality,Du Fu,Liu Langpu,"The sails are hung early and Liu Langpu is sent out, and the wind is rustling and the pavilion is in the afternoon. The boat is full of sand and dust all day long, and the empty villages on the shore are full of jackals and tigers. The north wind has not returned for ten days, and the guest travels to remind each other at the end of the year. White-headed and tired of staying with fishermen, yellow hats and blue shoes return home."
现实,杜甫,发同谷县,唐,贤有不黔突，圣有不煖席。况我饥愚人，焉能尚安宅。始来兹山中，休驾喜地僻。奈何迫物累，一岁四行役。忡忡去绝境，杳杳更远适。停骖龙潭云，回首白崖石。临岐别数子，握手泪再滴。交情无旧深，穷老多惨戚。平生懒拙意，偶值栖遁迹。去住与愿违，仰惭林间翮。,Reality,Du Fu,Fatong Valley County,"The virtuous have no excuses, the holy have no warm seats. What's more, I am a fool, how can I still live in a house. When I first came to the mountains, Hugh drove to a secluded place. However, I am tired of forcing things, and I am one year old and four lines of service. If you go to a desperate situation, you will be farther away. Stop at Longtan Cloud, look back at Baiyashi. Lin Qi said goodbye for a few sons, shook hands and shed tears again. Friendship is not old and deep, poor and old are miserable. I have been lazy and clumsy all my life, and I live in refuge occasionally. Going to live is counterproductive, and I look up to Lin Jianhe."
现实,杜甫,发秦州,唐,我衰更懒拙，生事不自谋。无食问乐土，无衣思南州。汉源十月交，天气凉如秋。草木未黄落，况闻山水幽。栗亭名更佳，下有良田畴。充肠多薯蓣，崖蜜亦易求。密竹复冬笋，清池可方舟。虽伤旅寓远，庶遂平生游。此邦俯要冲，实恐人事稠。应接非本性，登临未销忧。溪谷无异石，塞田始微收。岂复慰老夫，惘然难久留。日色隐孤戍，乌啼满城头。中宵驱车去，饮马寒塘流。磊落星月高，苍茫云雾浮。大哉乾坤内，吾道长悠悠。,Reality,Du Fu,Fa Qinzhou,"I am more lazy and clumsy, and I don't ask for trouble. Ask about paradise without food, think about Nanzhou without clothes. It is October in Hanyuan, and the weather is as cool as autumn. The vegetation has not fallen, and the mountains and rivers are quiet. The name of Liting is better, and there are good fields under it. There are many yams for filling the intestines, and cliff honey is also easy to find. Dense bamboo and winter bamboo shoots, clear ponds can be ark. Although it hurts to travel and live far away, the common people travel all their lives. This country is leaning forward, and it is really afraid that there will be a lot of personnel. Responding to non-nature, boarding has not relieved worries. There are no different stones in the valley, and the plug fields are beginning to harvest slightly. How can I comfort the old man, but it is difficult to stay for a long time in a daze. The sun is dark and lonely, and the crows are all over the city. Drive in the middle of the night and drink the horse cold pond stream. The stars and the moon are high, and the clouds and mists are floating. In the great universe, my way is long and long."
现实,杜甫,发阆中,唐,前有毒蛇后猛虎，溪行尽日无村坞。江风萧萧云拂地，山木惨惨天欲雨。女病妻忧归意速，秋花锦石谁复数。别家三月一得书，避地何时免愁苦。,Reality,Du Fu,hair langzhong,"There are poisonous snakes in the front and fierce tigers in the back, and the stream runs to the end of the day without village docks. The river wind is rustling and the clouds are blowing the ground, the mountains and trees are miserable and the sky is about to rain. The sick woman's wife is worried about returning home quickly, who is the number of autumn flowers, brocades and stones? When the other family gets the book once in March, when will the shelter be free from sorrow."
现实,杜甫,古柏行,唐,孔明庙前有老柏，柯如青铜根如石。霜皮溜雨四十围，黛色参天二千尺。君臣已与时际会，树木犹为人爱惜。云来气接巫峡长，月出寒通雪山白。忆昨路绕锦亭东，先主武侯同閟宫。崔嵬枝干郊原古，窈窕丹青户牖空。落落盘踞虽得地，冥冥孤高多烈风。扶持自是神明力，正直原因造化功。大厦如倾要梁栋，万牛回首丘山重。不露文章世已惊，未辞剪伐谁能送。苦心岂免容蝼蚁，香叶终经宿鸾凤。志士幽人莫怨嗟，古来材大难为用。,Reality,Du Fu,cooper line,"There is an old cypress in front of the Confucian Temple, and the Ke is like a bronze root like a stone. Frost skin slipped in the rain forty weeks, and the color of black towered two thousand feet. Monarchs and ministers have met with the times, and trees are still cherished by people. Clouds come to the air to meet the length of Wu Gorge, and the moon rises to be cold and snow-capped mountains are white. Recalling that the road went around the east of Jinting yesterday, the former Lord Wuhou Tongxi Palace. Cui Wei's branches are ancient and the suburbs are ancient, and the green households are empty. Although Luoluo is entrenched, it is lonely and high with strong winds. Supporting oneself is the power of the gods, and the work of righteousness and good fortune. The building is like leaning to Liang Dong, Wan Niu looks back and the hills are heavy. The world has been shocked without revealing the article, who can send it without cutting it. How can painstaking efforts tolerate ants, and the fragrant leaves will end up in Luanfeng. People with lofty ideals don't complain, the ancient materials are too difficult to use."
现实,杜甫,可叹,唐,天上浮云如白衣，斯须改变如苍狗。古往今来共一时，人生万事无不有。近者抉眼去其夫，河东女儿身姓柳。丈夫正色动引经，酆城客子王季友。群书万卷常暗诵，孝经一通看在手。贫穷老瘦家卖屐，好事就之为携酒。豫章太守高帝孙，引为宾客敬颇久。闻道三年未曾语，小心恐惧闭其口。太守得之更不疑，人生反覆看亦丑。明月无瑕岂容易，紫气郁郁犹冲斗。时危可仗真豪俊，二人得置君侧否。太守顷者领山南，邦人思之比父母。王生早曾拜颜色，高山之外皆培塿。用为羲和天为成，用平水土地为厚。王也论道阻江湖，李也丞疑旷前后。死为星辰终不灭，致君尧舜焉肯朽。吾辈碌碌饱饭行，风后力牧长回首。,Reality,Du Fu,deplorable,"The floating clouds in the sky are like white clothes, and the silk must change like a gray dog. Throughout the ages, there is a total of time, and everything in life is everything. Those who are close to him choose to go to their husbands. The daughter of Hedong is surnamed Liu. The husband is stern and citing scriptures, and the guest son of Fengcheng is Wang Jiyou. Tens of thousands of volumes of books are often recited in secret, and one book of filial piety is in hand. Poor, old and thin families sell clogs, and the good thing is to carry wine. The grandson of Emperor Gao, the prefect of Yuzhang, has been respected by guests for a long time. I heard that I haven't spoken for three years, so be careful and keep your mouth shut in fear. The prefect is even more suspicious of it, and life is ugly when you look at it repeatedly. It's not easy for the bright moon to be flawless, and the purple qi is still rushing. The time is dangerous and the real hero can be used, and the two of them have to take the king's side or not. The prefect leads Shannan, and the people of the state think more than their parents. Wang Sheng had long worshiped the color, and all the people outside the mountains cultivated the color. Use it for Xi and heaven for success, use flat water and land for thick. Wang Ye's discussion blocked the rivers and lakes, and Li Yecheng was suspicious. Death is the immortality of the stars, so that the rulers, Yao and Shun, are willing to die. Our generation is full of food and travel, and the chief shepherd looks back after the wind."
现实,杜甫,叹庭前甘菊花,唐,檐前甘菊移时晚，青蕊重阳不堪摘。明日萧条醉尽醒，残花烂熳开何益。篱边野外多众芳，采撷细琐升中堂。念兹空长大枝叶，结根失所缠风霜。,Reality,Du Fu,chamomile flower,"The chamomile in front of the eaves moved late, and the green pistils were unbearable to pick in Chongyang. Tomorrow, I will wake up from depression and drunkenness, what benefit will the remaining flowers bloom. There are many fragrances in the field by the fence, and the trivial things are picked up to the middle hall. Nian Zikong grows branches and leaves, and the roots are lost and entangled in wind and frost."
现实,杜甫,四松,唐,四松初移时，大抵三尺强。别来忽三载，离立如人长。会看根不拔，莫计枝凋伤。幽色幸秀发，疏柯亦昂藏。所插小藩篱，本亦有堤防。终然掁拨损，得吝千叶黄。敢为故林主，黎庶犹未康。避贼今始归，春草满空堂。览物叹衰谢，及兹慰凄凉。清风为我起，洒面若微霜。足以送老姿，聊侍偃盖张。我生无根带，配尔亦茫茫。有情且赋诗，事迹可两望。勿矜千载后，惨澹蟠穹苍。,Reality,Du Fu,four pine,"When the four pines first move, they are about three feet strong. Don't come and go for three years, leave and stand like a man. Will see if the roots are not pulled out, don't count the branches withered. The quiet color is lucky to have beautiful hair, and the sparse Ke is also hidden. The small fences inserted originally also had dikes. In the end, if you lose money, you have to be stingy with Chiba Huang. Dare to be the old forest owner, Li Shu is still not healthy. Avoiding thieves is now returning, and the spring grass is full of empty halls. I sigh and thank you for seeing things, and I am comforted by the desolation. The breeze rises for me, and the face is like a little frost. It's enough to send off Lao Zi and chat with Shi Yan and Gai Zhang. I was born with no roots, and my companionship is also vast. If you are affectionate and write poems, your deeds can be seen in two ways. Don't be shy after thousands of years, the sky will be miserable."
现实,杜甫,玄都坛歌寄元逸人,唐,故人昔隐东蒙峰，已佩含景苍精龙。故人今居子午谷，独在阴崖结茅屋。屋前太古玄都坛，青石漠漠常风寒。子规夜啼山竹裂，王母昼下云旗翻。知君此计成长往，芝草琅玕日应长。铁锁高垂不可攀，致身福地何萧爽。,Reality,Du Fu,Xuandu Altar Song Sends Yuan Yiren,"The old man used to hide in Dongmeng Peak, and has worn Jingcang Jinglong. The old man now lives in Ziwu Valley, and builds a thatched hut alone on the cliff. In front of the house is the ancient Xuandu altar, the bluestone is deserted and the wind is cold. Zigui sings mangosteen cracks at night, and the Queen Mother flies down the cloud flag at daytime. Zhijun's plan will grow, and Zhicao Langgan will grow day by day. The iron lock hangs high and cannot be reached, what a blessed place to be."
现实,杜甫,玉华宫,唐,溪回松风长，苍鼠窜古瓦。不知何王殿，遗构绝壁下。阴房鬼火青，坏道哀湍泻。万籁真笙竽，秋色正萧洒。美人为黄土，况乃粉黛假。当时侍金舆，故物独石马。忧来藉草坐，浩歌泪盈把。冉冉征途间，谁是长年者。,Reality,Du Fu,Yuhua Palace,"The stream returns to the pines and the wind grows, and the mice flee to the ancient tiles. I don't know what the king's palace is, the ruins are under the cliff. The ghosts in the yin chamber are green, and the bad roads are mournful. Wan Lai is really Shengyu, and the autumn scenery is chic. The beauty is loess, but the situation is fake. At that time, he served Jinyu, and the only old thing was a stone horse. Sorrows come to sit on the grass, and the songs are full of tears. During Ran Ran's journey, who is the elder."
现实,杜甫,甘林,唐,舍舟越西冈，入林解我衣。青刍适马性，好鸟知人归。晨光映远岫，夕露见日晞。迟暮少寝食，清旷喜荆扉。经过倦俗态，在野无所违。试问甘藜藿，未肯羡轻肥。喧静不同科，出处各天机。勿矜朱门是，陋此白屋非。明朝步邻里，长老可以依。时危赋敛数，脱粟为尔挥。相携行豆田，秋花霭菲菲。子实不得吃，货市送王畿。尽添军旅用，迫此公家威。主人长跪问，戎马何时稀。我衰易悲伤，屈指数贼围。劝其死王命，慎莫远奋飞。,Reality,Du Fu,Ganlin,"She boated across Xigang, went into the forest to untie my clothes. Green grass is suitable for horses, and good birds know people. The morning light reflects Yuanxiu, and the evening dew sees the sun. Late and late sleep and eat less, clear and happy Jingfei. After being tired and vulgar, nothing is violated in the field. Just ask Ganchen Huohuo, but I am not willing to envy light fat. The noise is different from different subjects, and comes from different secrets. Don't think that the rich family is right, but this white house is not. In the Ming Dynasty, the elders can follow the neighbors. When the crisis is over, the number is collected, and the millet is taken away. Together with the bean field, the autumn flowers are filled with Feifei. The seeds are really not edible, and they are sent to Wang Ji in the goods market. Do all the military use to force this public authority. The master knelt down and asked when the soldiers and horses were rare. I am prone to sadness when I am weak, and I am surrounded by thieves. Advise him to die and be ordered by the king, and be careful not to fly far away."
现实,杜甫,白马,唐,白马东北来，空鞍贯双箭。可怜马上郎，意气今谁见。近时主将戳，中夜商于战。丧乱死多门，呜呼泪如霰。,Reality,Du Fu,white horse,"The white horse comes from the northeast, with an empty saddle and two arrows. Poor Ma Lang, no one will see him today. Recently, the main general poked, and the businessmen fought in the middle of the night. Many families died in chaos, crying like hail."
现实,杜甫,白水县崔少府十九翁高斋三十韵,唐,客从南县来，浩荡无与适。旅食白日长，况当朱炎赫。高斋坐林杪，信宿游衍阒。清晨陪跻攀，傲睨俯峭壁。崇冈相枕带，旷野怀咫尺。始知贤主人，赠此遣愁寂。危阶根青冥，曾冰生淅沥。上有无心云，下有欲落石。泉声闻复急，动静随所击。鸟呼藏其身，有似惧弹射。吏隐道性情，兹焉其窟宅。白水见舅氏，诸翁乃仙伯。杖藜长松阴，作尉穷谷僻。为我炊雕胡，逍遥展良觌。坐久风颇愁，晚来山更碧。相对十丈蛟，歘翻盘涡坼。何得空里雷，殷殷寻地脉。烟氛蔼崷崒，魍魉森惨戚。昆崙崆峒颠，回首如不隔。前轩颓反照，巉绝华岳赤。兵气涨林峦，川光杂锋镝。知是相公军，铁马云雾积。玉觞淡无味，胡羯岂强敌。长歌激屋梁，泪下流衽席。人生半哀乐，天地有顺逆。慨彼万国夫，休明备征狄。猛将纷填委，庙谋蓄长策。东郊何时开，带甲且来释。欲告清宴罢，难拒幽明迫。三叹酒食旁，何由似平昔。,Reality,Du Fu,Baishui County Cui Shaofu Nineteen Weng Gao Zhai Thirty Rhymes,"The guests came from Nanxian County, and there was nothing suitable for them. The days of travel and food are long, and the situation is Zhu Yanhe. Gaozhai sits in the forest, and Xinsu travels in Yanyan. In the early morning, I accompany the climber, and look down on the cliff proudly. Chonggang is a pillow belt, and the wilderness is close at hand. Knowing the virtuous master at the beginning, I gave this sorrowful silence. The root of the dangerous stage is green and dark, and Zeng Bing gives birth to the patter. There is a cloud of unintentional above, and there is desire to fall to the rock below. When the sound of the spring is heard, it is urgent, and the movement and stillness follow the attack. The bird screams and hides itself, as if afraid of being ejected. Officials hide their temperament, so here is their cave house. Baishui sees my uncle's family, and all the old men are immortal uncles. Chenopodium stick grows in the pine shade, making Weiqionggu secluded. Cook and carve Hu for me, show off your good face at ease. Sitting for a long time, the wind is quite worrying, and the mountain is even greener when you come late. Compared with Shizhangjiao, 歘 turned around and vortexed. How can there be thunder in the sky, and search for the ground veins. The atmosphere of smoke is thick and thick, and the sprites are dense and miserable. The Kunlun Kongtong is in the top, looking back, it is as if it is not separated. The former Xuanxuan reflects, and the Huayue Chi is absolutely gorgeous. The military spirit rises, Lin Luan rises, Chuanguang miscellaneous front dysprosium. Knowing that it is the army of Xianggong, the iron horse is clouded. The jade cup is bland and tasteless, how can Hu Jie be a strong enemy. The long song shakes the beams of the house, and tears flow down the mat. Life is half-sorrowful and joyful, and there are pros and cons in the world. He is generous to the husband of all nations, and he is ready to conquer Di. The fierce generals filled the committees one after another, and the temple planned long-term strategies. When the eastern suburbs open, bring armor and come and release. If you want to tell the Qing banquet, it is difficult to resist the oppression of the dark. Three sighs beside the wine and food, why is it like the past."
现实,杜甫,白丝行,唐,缫丝须长不须白，越罗蜀锦金粟尺。象床玉手乱殷红，万草千花动凝碧。已悲素质随时染，裂下鸣机色相射。美人细意熨帖平，裁缝灭尽针线迹。春天衣著为君舞，蛱蝶飞来黄鹂语。落絮游丝亦有情，随风照日宜轻举。香汗轻尘污颜色，开新合故置何许。君不见才士汲引难，恐惧弃捐忍羁旅。,Reality,Du Fu,White silk line,"The reeled silk must be long but not white, the more Luo Shu brocade, the golden millet ruler. The jade hands on the elephant bed are chaotic and bright red, and the grass and flowers are moving and green. The quality of sadness has been dyed at any time, and the color of the machine will be shot under the crack. The beauty irons the post carefully, and the tailor eliminates all the stitches. In spring, I dress up and dance for the king, and nymphs and butterflies fly to speak of orioles. Falling fluff and gossamer are also sentimental, and should be lightly acted when the wind shines on the sun. Fragrant sweat, light dust and dirty color, what is the reason for opening a new one? Don't you see that it is difficult to recruit talented people, and fear and abandon donate and endure the brigade."
现实,杜甫,白凫行,唐,君不见黄鹄高于五尺童，化为白凫似老翁。故畦遗穗已荡尽，天寒岁暮波涛中。鳞介腥膻素不食，终日忍饥西复东。鲁门鶢鶋亦蹭蹬，闻道如今犹避风。,Reality,Du Fu,Bai Fu Xing,"Don't you see that Huang Hu is higher than Wu Chi Tong and turns into a white mallard like an old man. So the fringes left by the furrows have been wiped out, and the weather is cold and the waves are at the end of the year. The scales and fishy mutton don't eat, and they endure hunger all day long. Lu Men's 鶢鶋 also kicked and kicked, and heard that now he is still sheltering from the wind."
现实,杜甫,白沙渡,唐,畏途随长江，渡口下绝岸。差池上舟楫，杳窕入云汉。天寒荒野外，日暮中流半。我马向北嘶，山猿饮相唤。水清石礧礧，沙白滩漫漫。迥然洗愁辛，多病一疏散。高壁抵嵚崟，洪涛越凌乱。临风独回首，揽辔复三叹。,Reality,Du Fu,Baishadu,"Fearing the way, follow the Yangtze River, and the ferry goes down to the shore. Go to the boat on the wrong pool, and enter the cloud and Han Dynasty. Outside the cold wilderness, it's mid-sunset. My horse neighs to the north, and the mountain ape drinks and calls. The water is clear and the rocks are rough, and the sandy white beach is long. It's a shame to wash away your sorrows, and to evacuate when you are sick. When the high wall reached the bottom, the Hong Tao became more and more chaotic. Linfeng looks back alone, and sighs three times while holding the bridle."
现实,杜甫,白帝,唐,白帝城中云出门，白帝城下雨翻盆。高江急峡雷霆斗，翠木苍藤日月昏。戎马不如归马逸，千家今有百家存。哀哀寡妇诛求尽，恸哭秋原何处村。,Reality,Du Fu,White Emperor,"The cloud in Baidi City went out, and it rained heavily in Baidi City. The high river is rushing to the gorge, and the thunder is fighting, and the green trees and cang vines are dimmed by the sun and the moon. It is better to return to Ma Yi than to be a military horse. Thousands of families have hundreds of families today. Mourning for the widow's death, mourning for the village of Qiuyuan."
现实,杜甫,白帝城最高楼,唐,城尖径昃旌旆愁，独立缥缈之飞楼。峡坼云霾龙虎卧，江清日抱鼋鼍游。扶桑西枝对断石，弱水东影随长流。杖藜叹世者谁子，泣血迸空回白头。,Reality,Du Fu,The tallest building in Baidi City,"The city's tip is full of sorrows and sorrows, and it is an independent and ethereal flying building. In the gorge, clouds and haze, dragons and tigers lie down, and Jiang Qing swims with turtles in his arms. The west branch of hibiscus meets the broken stone, and the weak water and east shadow follow the long flow. Zhang Cheno sighs who is the son of the world, weeping blood bursts into the air and returns to the white head."
现实,杜甫,石文诗,唐,诗王本在陈芳国，九夜扪之麟篆熟，声振扶桑享天福。,Reality,Du Fu,Shi Wenshi,"The king of poetry was originally in Chen Fangguo, and he was familiar with the seal and seal script of Lin Lin in the nine nights."
现实,杜甫,石匮阁,唐,季冬日已长，山晚半天赤。蜀道多早花，江间饶奇石。石匮曾波上，临虚荡高壁。清晖回群鸥，暝色带远客。羁栖负幽意，感叹向绝迹。信甘孱懦婴，不独冻馁迫。优游谢康乐，放浪陶彭泽。吾衰未自安，谢尔性所适。,Reality,Du Fu,Shikui Pavilion,"The winter season is long, and the mountains are red in the middle of the night. The roads of Shu often bloom early, and there are strange stones in the river. The stone chamber once waved up, facing the void and swinging the high wall. Qinghui returns to the flock of gulls, and the dark color brings distant guests. The restrained dwelling bears a quiet meaning, and sighs towards extinction. Believe in the cowardly baby, not only cold and discouraged. Enjoy Xie Kangle, let go of Tao Pengze. My decline is not self-sufficient, but Xie Er's nature is suitable."
现实,杜甫,石研诗,唐,平公今诗伯，秀发吾所羡。奉使三峡中，长啸得石研。巨璞禹凿馀，异壮君独见。其滑乃波涛，其光或雷电。聊坳各尽墨，多水递隐现。挥洒容数人，十手可对面。比公头上冠，贞质未为贱。当公赋佳句，况得终清宴。公含起草姿，不远明光殿。致于丹青地，知汝随顾眄。,Reality,Du Fu,Shi Yanshi,"Ping Gong is now a poet, with beautiful hair, which I envy. In the Three Gorges of the envoy, Chang Xiao got Shi Yan. The giant Pu Yu chiseled the rest, and the king of Yi Zhuang saw it alone. Its smoothness is waves, its light or thunder and lightning. Chat Au each exhaust ink, much water delivery looming. Sway the number of people, ten hands can face each other. Crowned on the head of a male, chastity is not cheap. When the public writes a good sentence, the situation will end with a banquet. The public has a drafting posture, not far from the Mingguang Hall. To Danqing, I know that you follow Gu Kun."
现实,杜甫,石笋行,唐,君不见益州城西门，陌上石笋双高蹲。古来相传是海眼，苔藓蚀尽波涛痕。雨多往往得瑟瑟，此事恍惚难明论。恐是昔时卿相墓，立石为表今仍存。惜哉俗态好蒙蔽，亦如小臣媚至尊。政化错迕失大体，坐看倾危受厚恩。嗟尔石笋擅虚名，后来未识犹骏奔。安得壮士掷天外，使人不疑见本根。,Reality,Du Fu,Row of stalagmites,"Don't you see the west gate of Yizhou City, the stalagmites on Moshang are squatting at double heights. In ancient times, it was said that it was the eye of the sea, and the moss eroded the traces of the waves. It's rainy and often rustling, and it's hard to talk about it in a trance. I'm afraid it was the tomb of Prime Minister Qing in the past, and the standing stone still exists today as a sign. It's a pity that vulgarity is easy to deceive, just like a small minister flattering the Supreme. Politicization goes wrong and loses its generality, while sitting on the sidelines and receiving great kindness. The stalagmites of Heer are good at false names, but they didn't know You Junben later. Andy's strong man throws the sky, making people no doubt see the root."
现实,杜甫,石龛,唐,熊罴哮我东，虎豹号我西。我后鬼长啸，我前狨又啼。天寒昏无日，山远道路迷。驱车石龛下，仲冬见虹蜺。伐竹者谁子，悲歌上云梯。为官采美箭，五岁供梁齐。苦云直簳尽，无以充提携。奈何渔阳骑，飒飒惊烝黎。,Reality,Du Fu,stone niche,"The bear roars to my east, and the tiger and leopard roars to my west. My back ghost screams, and my front marmoset crows again. The sky is cold and the sun is dark, and the mountains are far away and the road is lost. Drive under the stone niche, see Hongni in midwinter. Who is the son of the bamboo cutter, the sad song goes up the ladder. Picking beautiful arrows for officials, offering to Liang Qi at the age of five. The bitter clouds are gone, and there is nothing to support. However, Yuyang rides, rustling and frightening Zhao Li."
现实,杜甫,石犀行,唐,君不见秦时蜀太守，刻石立作三犀牛。自古虽有厌胜法，天生江水向东流。蜀人矜誇一千载，汎溢不近张仪楼。今年灌口损户口，此事或恐为神羞。终藉堤防出众力，高拥木石当清秋。先王作法皆正道，鬼怪何得参人谋。嗟尔三犀不经济，缺讹只与长川逝。但见元气常调和，自免洪涛恣凋瘵。安得壮士提天纲，再平水土犀奔茫。,Reality,Du Fu,Stone Rhinoceros,"Don't you see that the prefect of Shu in Qin Dynasty carved stones and stood up as three rhinoceros. Although there is a law of disgusting victory since ancient times, the natural river flows eastward. Shu people have boasted for a thousand years, and the overflow is not close to Zhang Yilou. This year, it may be embarrassing to lose your household registration by filling your mouth. In the end, with the help of the outstanding strength of the embankment, the trees and stones are held high for the clear autumn. The methods of the former kings were all righteous, so how could ghosts and monsters get involved in the schemes of others. The three rhinos are not economical, and the lack of error only dies with Changchuan. But seeing that the vitality is always in harmony, it is inevitable that the Hong Tao will not wither. Andy's strong man puts forward the outline of the sky, and then runs to the vastness of the land."
现实,杜甫,石壕吏,唐,暮投石壕村，有吏夜捉人。老翁踰墙走，老妇出门看。吏呼一何怒，妇啼一何苦。听妇前致词，三男邺城戍。一男附书致，二男新战死。存者且偷生，死者长已矣。室中更无人，惟有乳下孙。有孙母未去，出入无完裙。老妪力虽衰，请从吏夜归。急应河阳役，犹得备晨炊。夜久语声绝，如闻泣幽咽。天明登前途，独与老翁别。,Reality,Du Fu,Shi Hao official,"In Mutou Shihao Village, officials arrested people at night. The old man walked over the wall, and the old woman went out to watch. Why are the officials angry, why are the women crying? Listening to the speech made by the wife, the three men were garrisoned in Yecheng. One man attached a letter, and the second man died in battle. The survivors live in stealth, and the dead are long gone. There is no one in the room, only grandchildren. There is a grandma who has not gone, and there is no end to the skirt. Although the old woman's strength is weak, please return from the official night. In response to the Heyang campaign, we still have to prepare the morning cooking. For a long time at night, there was no sound, as if weeping and swallowing. The day is on the way to the future, and I will say goodbye to the old man alone."
现实,杜甫,示从孙济,唐,平明跨驴出，未知适谁门。权门多噂?，且复寻诸孙。诸孙贫无事，宅舍如荒村。堂前自生竹，堂后自生萱。萱草秋已死，竹枝霜不蕃。淘米少汲水，汲多井水浑。刈葵莫放手，放手伤葵根。阿翁懒惰久，觉儿行步奔。所来为宗族，亦不为盘飧。小人利口实，薄俗难可论。勿受外嫌猜，同姓古所敦。,Reality,Du Fu,Sun Ji,"I don't know who is suitable for Ping Ming to step out of the donkey. There are many rich and powerful families, and they will look for their grandchildren again. Zhusun is poor and has nothing to do, and his house is like a deserted village. Bamboo grows in front of the hall, and Xuan Xuan grows in the back of the hall. The daylilies are dead in autumn, and the bamboo branches are not frosty. Washing rice seldom draws water, but more well water is muddy. Don't let go of the sunflower, let it hurt the sunflower root. A Weng has been lazy for a long time, and Jue'er walks and runs. It is the clan, not the plate. The villain is eloquent, and it is hard to talk about vulgarity. Don't be suspected by outsiders, the same surname is Gu Suodun."

Xuan Chan keeps calling, and Qiuyan is already like a guest. I go to wish alone in my life, and I am sad for half a hundred years. It is also up to the person to be dismissed from office. What is the matter of detention?"
现实,杜甫,龙门阁,唐,清江下龙门，绝壁无尺土。长风驾高浪，浩浩自太古。危途中萦盘，仰望垂线缕。滑石攲谁凿，浮梁袅相拄。目眩陨杂花，头风吹过雨。百年不敢料，一坠那得取。饱闻经瞿塘，足见度大庾。终身历艰险，恐惧从此数。,Reality,Du Fu,Longmen Pavilion,"The Qingjiang River goes down to Longmen, and there is no foot of soil on the cliff. The long wind drives the high waves, Haohao is from ancient times. Wandering in crisis, looking up at the vertical thread. Whoever chiseled the talc, the floating beams will stick to each other. Dazzled and scattered flowers, the wind blows through the rain. I can't predict it for a hundred years, and I can get it once I drop it. I have heard about Qutang, so I can see Dayu. I have lived through hardships and dangers throughout my life, and my fears have never been counted."
现实,杜甫,龙门镇,唐,细泉兼轻冰，沮洳栈道湿。不辞辛苦行，迫此短景急。石门雪云隘，古镇峰峦集。旌竿暮惨澹，风水白刃涩。胡马屯成皋，防虞此何及。嗟尔远戍人，山寒夜中泣。,Reality,Du Fu,Longmen Town,"The thin spring and light ice make the plank road wet. Working tirelessly, this short-term situation is urgent. Shimen Snow Cloud Pass, the ancient town of mountains and mountains. The twilight of Jinggan is bleak, and Fengshui's white blade is astringent. Humatun Chenggao, what is the defense against Yu. You are far away from the garrison, and weep in the cold night of the mountains."
现实,杜甫,光禄坂行,唐,山行落日下绝壁，西望千山万山赤。树枝有鸟乱鸣时，暝色无人独归客。马惊不忧深谷坠，草动只怕长弓射。安得更似开元中，道路即今多拥隔。,Reality,Du Fu,Guanglu Banxing,"Walking in the mountains, the sun sets on the cliffs, looking west at thousands of mountains and thousands of red mountains. When there are birds chirping in the branches, no one returns alone in the dark. The horse is not afraid of falling into the deep valley when it is frightened, but the grass is only afraid of shooting with a long bow. Ande is more like Kaiyuan Middle School, where the roads are more crowded now."

In the midst of thieves and thieves, he is in a mess in Jianghan. When you sigh, the potency of the medicine is weak, and it will be successful for the guest. We are a talented poet, and we are well-known in the world. Cancanyuan Daozhou, the former saint fears the later. Watch and call Chongling's work, and see Junzhe's love. Review the thief's exit, and the knot is also true Guozhen. Jia Yi used to mourn, and Kuang Heng often quoted scriptures. Daozhou is worried about Li Shu, and his words are full of vigor. The two chapters are about Qiuyue, and the word is about Huaxing. To the king, Tang Yuji, simply recalling the big court. When will the seal book be issued, and I will use you as the picture. Prison lawsuits will never die, but Yan Jiabing is the only one. Sorrowful thoughts and begging, thin and close to Xiu Ming. He knows what people want, and he doesn't care about flying long tassels. Liang Biao shook Nanyue, and his son was overjoyed. The color resistance is large and the gold seal is large, and the waves are clear. I have been sick for so long, and I miss the court day and night. Too dry and thirsty, wandering in Gongsun City. Hu'er has paper and pen, hidden a few Linxuan couplets. Moaning in the poem, the word Heitan is pouring. Those who feel the danger and suffering of the other will listen to it."

Since he is not Kuang Shihuai, Denzi turns over Baiyou. Knowing the teaching power of Xiang, it is enough to chase after Mingsou. Looking up through the Dragon and Snake Cave, the branches begin to support the quiet. The seven stars are in Beitou, and the sound of the Milky Way flows westward. Xihe flogs the day, Shaohao travels in the clear autumn. The Qin Mountains suddenly shattered, and the Wei and Wei could not be sought. Looking down but looking down at one breath, how can one distinguish Huangzhou. Looking back, he was called Yu Shun, and Cang Wu was worried.

Sven Cui Weitu, I am like Bunyan. Qiling is strong in thinking, and opens his mouth to sing about Fenghuang. The big characters of Jiulingshu are made into a bag. Sexual arrogance, alcoholism, jealousy and stubbornness. Get rid of the younger generation, make friends with old people. Drinking and watching the eight poles, the vulgar things are boundless. Going east to Gusu Terrace, it has become a floating sea voyage. So far, there is a grudge, and I can't get poor Fusang. Wang Xie is far away, and the tomb of Heluqiu is deserted. The stone walls of Jianchi are flat, and the lotus in Changzhou is fragrant. To the north of Saga Changmen, the Qing Temple is reflected in the pond. Every time I approach Taibo Wu, I caress the waves of tears. Reminiscing about Goujian, crossing Zhejiang and thinking about Emperor Qin. The steamed fish smells the dagger, except for the Tao. Yue Nu is white in the world, and Jianhu Lake is cool in May. The beauty of Yanxi River is so beautiful that you can't forget it if you want to stop. Returning to Fan Futian Grandma, the middle-aged tribute to the old hometown. Qi Qu Jia Lei, short-sighted Cao Liu Qiang. Disobeyed to take the test of merit, and resigned from Jingyin hall alone.

In eight or nine years, I returned to Xianyang from the west. Xu Yubi Ci Bo, tour the real virtuous king. Put the garment on the ground, and play Fu into the bright light. The emperor abandoned food and called, and the group guilds will show off their clothes. Get away with nothing to love, drink Xinxingzang. The sable is unavoidable, and the temples are called cups. Duqu is late and old, and there are many poplars in the surrounding suburbs. Sitting deep in the township party, I feel busy day by day. The rich families were overwhelmed, and the red people suffered disasters one after another. The national horse exhausts millet and beans, and the official chicken loses rice and sorghum. Seeing troubles and expenses from the corner, citing the ancients and cherishing the rise and fall. The wind and dust in Heshuo rose, and the trip to Minshan was long. The two palaces are guarded by each other, facing each other thousands of miles away. The murderous spirit of Kongtong is black, and the flag of Shaohai is yellow. Yu Gong also ordered his son, and Zhuolu went to the army. Cuihua embraces Yingyue, and Chihu devours jackals. When the minions miss, Hu Bing moves to Lu Liang. The army is loaded with grass, withered and full of disease. The reserve staff steals and makes up for it, full of worry and indignation. On the top, I feel that the nine temples are burned, and on the bottom, I feel sorry for the sores of the people. At that time, Fu Qingpu was fighting to guard the imperial bed. Jun Hun dared to love death, He Nu was fortunately unharmed. The sages are benevolent and forgiving, and Yu County will return to a well-off life. In the ashes of the crying temple, the nose is sour towards Weiyang. The little ministers talk about it, and the old and sick customers have different prescriptions. Depressed and suffering, Yu He is trapped and low. The autumn wind moves the valley of sorrow, and Bihui donates her fragrance. If you avoid rewards, the fisherman washes the waves. Prosperity is the enemy of honor, and there is severe frost at the end of the year. In my opinion, Yizi is very unusual. The group of vicious men is still undecided, standing side by side handsome Xiang Xiang."

The fisherman's net is freezing in the cold weather, and don't shoot the wild goose and the mulberry bow. Last year, rice was expensive and the army was fed, but this year rice is cheap and hurts farmers. High-level motor officials are tired of wine and meat, and this generation is empty-handed. Chu people value fish more than birds, so Ruxiu killed Nan Feihong in vain. It's been heard that men and women are everywhere, and they cut kindness, forbearance and love and return rent. In the past, money was used for smuggling and casting, but now lead, tin and bronze are allowed. Carved clay is the easiest to get, and likes and dislikes are not compatible with each other.

As the darkness falls, the thunderstorm falls, and the pine root monk rests lonely. Pang Meihao has no head, and his right shoulder is uncovered and his feet are exposed.

现实,杜甫,江头五咏 其一 丁香,唐,丁香体柔弱，乱结枝犹垫。细叶带浮毛，疏花披素艳。深栽小斋后，庶近幽人占。晚堕兰麝中，休怀粉身念。,Reality,Du Fu,"One of the Five Songs of Jiangtou, Lilac","The body of cloves is weak and weak, and the branches are like mats. Thin leaves with floating hairs, sparse flower cape plain. After planting Xiaozhai deeply, the common people occupy it near Youren.

现实,杜甫,江汉,唐,江汉思归客，乾坤一腐儒。片云天共远，永夜月同孤。落日心犹壮，秋风病欲疏。古来存老马，不必取长途。,Reality,Du Fu,Jianghan,"Jiang Han thinks about returning to the guest, and the universe is a rotten Confucian. The sky and the sky are far away, and the moon and the moon are alone forever. The heart is still strong in the setting sun, and the autumn wind is sick. In ancient times, there is no need to take long distances to save old horses."
现实,杜甫,江雨有怀郑典设,唐,春雨闇闇塞峡中，早晚来自楚王宫。乱波分披已打岸，弱云狼籍不禁风。宠光蕙叶与多碧，点注桃花舒小红。谷口子真正忆汝，岸高瀼滑限西东。,Reality,Du Fu,Jiang Yu Youhuai Zheng Dianshe,"The spring rain is secretly in the gorge, and sooner or later it comes from the Chu Palace. The chaotic waves have already hit the shore, and the weak clouds are in a mess. Pet Guang Huiye and Duobi, point to the peach blossom Shu Xiaohong. Taniguchi really remembers you, and the bank is high and slippery, limited to the west and the east."
现实,杜甫,江阁对雨有怀行营裴二端公,唐,南纪风涛壮，阴晴屡不分。野流行地日，江入度山云。层阁凭雷殷，长空水面文。雨来铜柱北，应洗伏波军。,Reality,Du Fu,Jiang Ge is pregnant with the rain and camps Pei Erduangong,"Nanji is full of strong winds and waves, and there is no distinction between cloudy and sunny. The sun is popular in the wild, and the river enters the mountains and clouds. The pavilions are based on Lei Yin, and the text on the water surface in the sky.

现实,杜甫,百忧集行,唐,忆年十五心尚孩，健如黄犊走复来。庭前八月梨枣熟，一日上树能千回。即今倏忽已五十，坐卧只多少行立。强将笑语供主人，悲见生涯百忧集。入门依旧四壁空，老妻睹我颜色同。痴儿未知父子礼，叫怒索饭啼门东。,Reality,Du Fu,Prozac,"Reminiscing that I was still a child at the age of fifteen, and came back as healthy as a yellow calf. Before the court, pears and jujubes are ripe in August, and they can climb a tree a thousand times a day. Now it is suddenly fifty, sitting and lying can only walk and stand. Forcing the laughter to the master, sad to see the set of worries about life. The entrance is still empty, and my old wife sees me with the same color. The idiot doesn't know the rituals of father and son, so he calls out for food and shouts at the east of the door."
现实,杜甫,自平,唐,自平宫中吕太一，收珠南海千馀日。近供生犀翡翠稀，复恐征戎干戈密。蛮溪豪族小动摇，世封刺史非时朝。蓬莱殿前诸主将，才如伏波不得骄。,Reality,Du Fu,self-leveling,"From Lu Taiyi in the Ping Palace, he collected the pearl from the South China Sea for more than a thousand days. Rhinoceros and emeralds are scarce in the near future, and there is fear of conquering Ronggan Gemi again. The wealthy clan of Manxi wavered a little, and the governor of the world was not in the right time. The chief generals in front of the Penglai Palace are just like Fubo without pride."
现实,杜甫,自京赴奉先县咏怀五百字,唐,杜陵有布衣，老大意转拙。许身一何愚，窃比稷与契。居然成濩落，白手甘契阔。盖棺事则已，此志常觊豁。穷年忧黎元，叹息肠内热。取笑同学翁，浩歌弥激烈。非无江海志，萧洒送日月。生逢尧舜君，不忍便永诀。当今廊庙具，构厦岂云缺。葵藿倾太阳，物性固莫夺。顾惟蝼蚁辈，但自求其穴。胡为慕大鲸，辄拟偃溟渤。以兹悟生理，独耻事干谒。兀兀遂至今，忍为尘埃没。终愧巢与由，未能易其节。沈饮聊自适，放歌颇愁绝。岁暮百草零，疾风高冈裂。天衢阴峥嵘，客子中夜发。霜严衣带断，指直不得结。凌晨过骊山，御榻在嵽嵲。蚩尤塞寒空，蹴蹋崖谷滑。瑶池气郁律，羽林相摩戛。君臣留欢娱，乐动殷樛嶱。赐浴皆长缨，与宴非短褐。彤庭所分帛，本自寒女出。鞭挞其夫家，聚敛贡城阙。圣人筐篚恩，实欲邦国活。臣如忽至理，君岂弃此物。多士盈朝廷，仁者宜战慄。况闻内金盘，尽在卫霍室。中堂舞神仙，烟雾散玉质。煖客貂鼠裘，悲管逐清瑟。劝客驼蹄羹，霜橙压香橘。朱门酒肉臭，路有冻死骨。荣枯咫尺异，惆怅难再述。北辕就泾渭，官渡又改辙。群冰从西下，极目高崒兀。疑是崆峒来，恐触天柱折。河梁幸未坼，枝撑声窸窣。行旅相攀援，川广不可越。老妻寄异县，十口隔风雪。谁能久不顾，庶往共饥渴。入门闻号咷，幼子饥已卒。吾宁舍一哀，里巷亦呜咽。所愧为人父，无食致夭折。岂知秋未登，贫窭有仓卒。生常免租税，名不隶征伐。抚迹犹酸辛，平人固骚屑。默思失业徒，因念远戍卒。忧端齐终南，澒洞不可掇。,Reality,Du Fu,From Beijing to Fengxian County Yonghuai five hundred words,"Du Ling has commoner clothes, but the boss is careless and clumsy. What a fool Xu Shen is, stealing the rice and the deed. It turned out that Cheng Luoluo was willing to be generous with nothing. The matter of building the coffin is over, and this ambition is always open. In the poor year, I worry about Li Yuan and sigh for the heat in my intestines. Making fun of classmate Weng, Hao Gemi is fierce. Not without Jiang Haizhi, sending the sun and the moon in a chic way. Born to meet Lord Yao and Shun, if you can't bear it, you will say goodbye forever. Today's corridors and temples are not lacking in building buildings. Kui Huo leans against the sun, and its physical properties are solid. Gu Wei is a generation of ants, but he seeks his own nest. Hu is Mu Dajing, and he imitates Yan Ming Bo. In order to understand physiology, I am only ashamed of doing things. So far, Wu Wu has endured as dust. I am ashamed of the nest and you, and I have not been able to change its knot. Shen drinks and chats to be comfortable, and singing is quite worrying. At the end of the year, there are no herbs, and the wind is high and the hills are cracked. The Tianqu is cloudy and towering, and the guests are in the middle of the night. The frost is severe, and the belt of the clothes is broken, and the fingers cannot be straightened. After passing Lishan Mountain in the early morning, the imperial couch is in Heyi. Chi You is in the cold sky, kicking the cliffs and valleys. The qi of Yao Chi is melancholy and lawful, and the feather forest is in harmony. The monarchs and ministers stay for entertainment, and the music moves Yin Yuxi. The bathing is all long tassels, and the banquet is not short brown. The silk divided by Tongting is originally from Hannv. He whipped his husband's family and gathered tribute to the city. The sage basket basket is kind, and he really wants to live the country. If the subject suddenly arrives at the truth, how can you abandon this thing. The benevolent should tremble when Duoshi is full of the court. It is said that the inner gold plate is all in Wei Huo's room. The middle hall dances with immortals, and the smoke is scattered with jade. Warm guest ermine fur, sad tube by clear. Persuading customers to comel's hoof soup, cream orange pressed fragrant orange. While the rich wine and meat smell, the road with frozen bone. Prosperity and decline are very close, and it is difficult to describe the melancholy. Beiyuan is Jingwei, and Guandu has changed again. The group of ice descends from the west, and the extreme eyes are high and steep. It is suspected that Kongtong is coming, and I am afraid that the sky pillar will be broken. Fortunately, the river beams were not yet broken, and the branches were rustling. When traveling and climbing, Sichuan and Guangxi cannot be crossed. The old wife is sent to another county, and the ten people are separated by wind and snow. Who can ignore it for a long time, and share the hunger and thirst. The first entry is famous, and the youngest son died of hunger. I would rather give up a mourning, and weep in the alley. Ashamed of being a father, he died young without food. Unexpectedly, the autumn is not on the horizon, and the poor are in a hurry. Life is often exempt from rent and tax, and the name is not subject to conquest. Touching traces is still sour and pungent, ordinary people are solid and crumbs. Meditate on the unemployed, and die because of reading far away. Worry about Qi Zhongnan, and you can't stop the hole."
现实,杜甫,至后,唐,冬至至后日初长，远在剑南思洛阳。青袍白马有何意，金谷铜驼非故乡。梅花欲开不自觉，棣萼一别永相望。愁极本凭诗遣兴，诗成吟咏转凄凉。,Reality,Du Fu,to the end,"After the winter solstice, the day begins to grow, far away in Jiannan Siluoyang. What is the meaning of the green robe and white horse? The golden valley copper camel is not the hometown. The plum blossoms are about to bloom unconsciously, and the dicalyx and the calyx will see each other forever. Anxiety is based on poetry, and poetry becomes chanting and turns to desolation."
现实,杜甫,舟中苦热遣怀奉呈阳中丞通简台省诸公,唐,愧为湖外客，看此戎马乱。中夜混黎氓，脱身亦奔窜。平生方寸心，反掌帐下难。呜呼杀贤良，不叱白刃散。吾非丈夫特，没齿埋冰炭。耻以风病辞，胡然泊湘岸。入舟虽苦热，垢腻可溉灌。痛彼道边人，形骸改昏旦。中丞连帅职，封内权得按。身当问罪先，县实诸侯半。士卒既辑睦，启行促精悍。似闻上游兵，稍逼长沙馆。邻好彼克修，天机自明断。南图卷云水，北拱戴霄汉。美名光史臣，长策何壮观。驱驰数公子，咸愿同伐叛。声节衰有馀，夫何激衰懦。偏裨表三上，卤莽同一贯。始谋谁其间，回首增愤惋。宗英李端公，守职甚昭焕。变通迫胁地，谋画焉得算。王室不肯微，凶徒略无惮。此流须卒斩，神器资强干。扣寂豁烦襟，皇天照嗟叹。,Reality,Du Fu,The bitterness and heat in the boat sent to the princes of Chengyang Zhongcheng Tongjian Taiwan Province,"Ashamed to be a guest outside the lake, look at the chaos of soldiers and horses. In the middle of the night, he is a hooligan, and he runs away when he escapes. It's hard to turn your back on the tent if you have a square heart in your life. Huh, kill the virtuous, don't scold the virtuous. I am not a husband, I have no teeth to bury ice charcoal. Ashamed of saying goodbye to wind and disease, Hu Ran parked on the shore of Xiang'an. Although entering the boat is bitter and hot, it can be irrigated if the dirt is greasy. People on the other side of the road hurt each other, and their bodies change to faint. In the post of commander-in-chief of Zhongcheng, the right to be sealed can be granted. The body should be questioned first, and the county is half a prince. The soldiers are well-organized, and they start to promote leanness. It seems that there are soldiers from the upper reaches, forcing the Changsha Pavilion a little bit. Neighboring Pixiu, the secret is self-evident. The south picture rolls clouds and water, and the north arch wears Dai Xiaohan. The reputation of Guang Shichen, the long-term strategy is spectacular. Drive a few sons, and I am willing to fight rebels together. There is more than enough decay in the syllable, so why is the husband weak and cowardly? Partial benefit table three, reckless consistent. When I started to seek someone, I looked back and increased my anger and regret. Zongying and Li Duangong are very good at their duties. To adapt to coercion and coercion, it is impossible to plan. The royal family refuses to be shy, and the murderer is a little fearless. This flow must be cut off, and the artifacts must be strong. Buckle the silent and open the troubled lapels, and Huang Tianzhao sighs."
现实,杜甫,行次古城店泛江作不揆鄙拙奉呈江陵幕府诸公,唐,老年常道路，迟日复山川。白屋花开里，孤城麦秀边。济江元自阔，下水不劳牵。风蝶勤依浆，春鸥懒避船。王门高德业，幕府盛才贤。行色兼多病，苍茫泛爱前。,Reality,Du Fu,"Traveling to the ancient city shop, Fanjiang works are not humble and humble, and presented to the princes of the Jiangling shogunate","Old age is always on the road, and mountains and rivers will be restored sooner or later.

现实,杜甫,行官张望补稻畦水归,唐,东屯大江北，百顷平若案。六月青稻多，千畦碧泉乱。插秧适云已，引溜加溉灌。更仆往方塘，决渠当断岸。公私各地著，浸润无天旱。主守问家臣，分明见溪伴。芊芊炯翠羽，剡剡生银汉。欧鸟镜里来，关山云边看。秋菰成黑米，精凿传白粲。玉粒足晨炊，红鲜任霞散。终然添旅食，作苦期壮观。遗穗及众多，我仓戒滋蔓。,Reality,Du Fu,Executing officials look around to replenish the rice paddies and return,"Dongtun Dajiangbei, a hundred hectares are as flat as a case. In June, there is a lot of green rice, and thousands of fields and green springs are chaotic. Transplanting rice seedlings is suitable for the cloud, lead slip and add irrigation. Even more servants went to Fangtang, and decided that the canal should be broken. Public and private everywhere, soaked without drought. The main guard asked his retainers, and he clearly saw the companion of the stream. Qianqian Jiong Cuiyu, Yan Yan born Yinhan. Ou Niao came in the mirror, and Guan Shanyun looked at it. Autumn wild rice becomes black rice, and it is finely chiseled to pass on white charm. The jade grains are full of morning cooking, and the red freshness is scattered. Finally, food and travel will be added, and the bitter period will be spectacular. Leftover spikes and many, my storehouse quits growing vines."
现实,杜甫,西枝村寻置草堂地夜宿赞公土室二首 其一,唐,出郭眄细岑，披榛得微路。溪行一流水，曲折方屡渡。赞公汤休徒，好静心迹素。昨枉霞上作，盛论岩中趣。怡然共携手，恣意同远步。扪萝涩先登，陟巘眩反顾。要求阳冈暖，苦陟阴岭冱。惆怅老大藤，沈吟屈蟠树。卜居意未展，杖策回且暮。层巅馀落日，早蔓已多露。,Reality,Du Fu,"Xizhi Village found a thatched cottage to stay overnight in Zangong Tushi, one of the two poems","Go out of Guo Yu Xicen, and wear hazel to get a small road. The stream is a first-rate stream, with twists and turns and repeated crossings. Zan Gong Tang Xiutu, so calm and simple. Yesterday, vain xia made it up, and talked about the interest in the rock. Let's join hands together happily and walk far away together. Touch the radish first, and go back to the dizzy. Yanggang is required to be warm, but Yinling is bitter. The melancholy old vine, pondering Qu Panshu. Bu Juyi has not developed, and the staff is back and it is dusk. The sun is setting on the top of the layer, and the early vines are already exposed."
现实,杜甫,西枝村寻置草堂地夜宿赞公土室二首 其二,唐,天寒鸟已归，月出人更静。土室延白光，松门耿疏影。跻攀倦日短，语乐寄夜永。明燃林中薪，暗汲石底井。大师京国旧，德业天机秉。从来支许游，兴趣江湖迥。数奇谪关塞，道广存箕颍。何知戎马间，复接尘事屏。幽寻岂一路，远色有诸岭。晨光稍曚昽，更越西南顶。,Reality,Du Fu,Xizhi Village is looking for a thatched cottage to stay overnight in Zan Gong's earthen room.,"The weather is cold and the bird has returned, and the moon rises and people are quieter. The earth room extends the white light, and the pine door Geng Shuying. The days of climbing are short, and the language and music are sent to the night forever. Burning the salary in the forest, and drawing the stone bottom well in the dark. Master Jingguo is old, and his virtues and careers are full of secrets. I have never supported Xu You, and my interests range from rivers and lakes. A few odd banished to Guansai, Daoguang kept Jiying. How do you know that between soldiers and horses, the dust screen will be reconnected. Is there any way to search for you, there are mountains in the distance. The morning light is a little bit late, and it is getting more and more southwest."
现实,杜甫,西阁曝日,唐,凛冽倦玄冬，负暄嗜飞阁。羲和流德泽，颛顼愧倚薄。毛发具自和，肌肤潜沃若。太阳信深仁，衰气歘有托。攲倾烦注眼，容易收病脚。流离木杪猿，翩跹山颠鹤。用知苦聚散，哀乐日已作。即事会赋诗，人生忽如昨。古来遭丧乱，贤圣尽萧索。胡为将暮年，忧世心力弱。,Reality,Du Fu,Xige Exposure Day,"Bitter and tired Xuandong, negative Xuan loves Feige. Xihe Liu Deze, Zhuanxu is ashamed and leaning on thin. The hair is soft and the skin is fertile. The sun is trustworthy and benevolent, and there are trusts in the decline of Qi. Focus on the eyes, it is easy to get sick feet. The wandering wood ape, the crane flying over the mountain. Gather and disperse with the knowledge of suffering, the day of mourning and joy has been done. Immediately know how to compose poems, life suddenly seems like yesterday. In ancient times, there were chaos and chaos, and the sages were all desolate. Hu Wei is in his twilight years, worried about the world and weak in heart."
现实,杜甫,观公孙大娘弟子舞剑器行,唐,昔有佳人公孙氏，一舞剑气动四方。观者如山色沮丧，天地为之久低昂。㸌如羿射九日落，矫如群帝骖龙翔。来如雷霆收震怒，罢如江海凝清光。绛唇珠袖两寂莫，况有弟子传芬芳。临颍美人在白帝，妙舞此曲神扬扬。与余问答既有以，感时抚事增惋伤。先帝侍女八千人，公孙剑器初第一。五十年间似反掌，风尘倾动昏王室。梨园子弟散如烟，女乐馀姿映寒日。金粟堆南木已拱，瞿唐石城草萧瑟。玳筵急管曲复终，乐极哀来月东出。老夫不知其所往，足茧荒山转愁疾。,Reality,Du Fu,Watching Gongsun Da Niang's disciples dancing swords,"In the past, there was a beautiful woman named Gongsun, who moved all directions with her sword dance. The viewers are as depressed as the mountains, and the sky and the earth are low for a long time.㸌It's like Yi shooting nine sunsets, and it's like a dragon flying like a group of emperors. Come like a thunderbolt, stop the wrath, stop like Jiang Hai condenses the light. Crimson lips and pearl sleeves are silent, but some disciples pass on the fragrance. The beauty of Linying is in Baidi, and she dances this song wonderfully. Since I had a question and answer with Yu, I feel more regretful and hurt when I care about it. Among the eight thousand maids of the first emperor, Gongsun Jianqi was the first. Fifty years seem to turn the palm of your hand, and the wind and dust have shaken the royal family. The children of the Liyuan are scattered like smoke, and the rest of the female singers reflect the cold sun. The golden millet heap and the south wood have been arched, and the grass in the stone city of Qutang is bleak. Dai Yan is in a hurry to return to the end of the song, and the moon comes out in the east with great joy and sorrow. The old man doesn't know where he's going, and he's full of cocoons and barren mountains."
现实,杜甫,观打鱼歌,唐,绵州江水之东津，鲂鱼鱍鱍色胜银。渔人漾舟沈大网，截江一拥数百鳞。众鱼常才尽却弃，赤鲤腾出如有神。潜龙无声老蛟怒，回风飒飒吹沙尘。饔子左右挥双刀，脍飞金盘白雪高。徐州秃尾不足忆，汉阴槎头远遁逃。鲂鱼肥美知第一，既饱欢娱亦萧瑟。君不见朝来割素鬐，咫尺波涛永相失。,Reality,Du Fu,Watch Fishing Song,"In Dongjin of the Mianzhou River, the color of bream fish is better than silver. The fisherman's boat sinks a large net, and the river is surrounded by hundreds of scales. All the fish often give up when they run out of talent, and the red carp vacates like a god. The Qianlong is silent and the old Jiao is angry, and the returning wind blows the dust. The scorpion wields two knives left and right, and the golden plate is flying high with white snow. Xuzhou's bald tail has no memory, and Hanyin Chatou fled far away. Bream is the most plump and beautiful fish, full of joy and desolation. Don't you see that when the dynasty comes to cut off the plain, the waves will be lost forever."
现实,杜甫,观薛稷少保书画壁,唐,少保有古风，得之陕郊篇。惜哉功名忤，但见书画传。我游梓州东，遗迹涪江边。画藏青莲界，书入金榜悬。仰看垂露姿，不崩亦不骞。郁郁三大字，蛟龙岌相缠。又挥西方变，发地扶屋椽。惨澹壁飞动，到今色未填。此行叠壮观，郭薛俱才贤。不知百载后，谁复来通泉。,Reality,Du Fu,Watching Xue Ji Shaobao Calligraphy and Painting Wall,"Keep the ancient style less, and get the chapters in the suburbs of Shaanxi. It's a pity that the fame and fame are disobedient, but see the biography of calligraphy and painting. I traveled to the east of Zizhou, along the Fujiang River. Painting the Tibetan Qinglian circle, the book is hung on the gold list. Looking up at the dew posture, neither collapse nor Qiang. The three characters of Yu Yu are entwined with each other. And wield the West Transformation, send out the ground to support the rafters of the house. The bleak wall is flying, and the color is not filled. This trip is spectacular, Guo Xueju is a talented person. I don't know who will come to Tongquan after a hundred years."

What's more, if you are married and can't sell it, it's a pity to hold grudges all your life. In the local customs, the male sits and the female stands, and the female should come in and out. Nine times out of ten, the wages are negative, and the money from selling wages should be supplied. To the old double servant girls only hang their necks, and the wild flowers, mountains and leaves are joined by silver hairpins. The strength of the muscles ascends the gate of the dangerous market, and the life and death shoot at the salt well. Face makeup and jewelry are full of weeping marks, and the ground is cold and the roots of the rocks are trapped. If you say that the Wushan girl is rough and ugly, how can there be Zhaojun Village here?"

The gentle wind attracts the osmanthus, and the clouds rise in spring. Looking back at Jinkou, there are many maple forests. White fish are trapped in dense nets, and yellow birds are making noise.

Dai Gongwei Tongquan, how comfortable it is. Jifu Denggun crowned, straight and gushing. It's not normal to see strangers openly. After deciding on the dragon, the palace is clear. Erqing distinguishes relatives, directs and saves Gu Tuo. The public is ashamed, and the royal family is not weakened. On the famous minister, Danqing Zhaotai Pavilion. The relics I have traveled, the pools and halls are all dredged. When Zhuang Gong came to a conclusion, Gu Bu's tears fell. In the chapter of Gao Yong's sword, God delivered it to Ming Mo."

The cloudy wind blows thousands of miles away, blowing the house on the Rujiang River. The name of the chicken is in Wangzhu, and the sun is next to the rice fields. May I ask the old man who holds the axe, he has been a guest from Changsha for a few years. Mourning for the loss of the tree, correcting and avoiding the bow. I also know the joy of my hometown, but I dare not think about the past. In the past, in Fengxiang Capital, they shared a golden boudoir. The son of heaven is still covered with dust, and the eastern suburbs are dark with long halberds. Military strategists avoid spies, and this generation often contacts. Taichung leads the impeachment, and you must carefully analyze it. I can't bear to kill innocent people, so I distinguish between right and wrong. The Shangguan has the right to agree with him, but he loses his opinion and reprimands him. Zhongnigan traveler, Xiangzi knows the profit and loss. The imperial court didn't know, so they shut up and sighed. In the rest of the time, he was admonishing ministers, and Dan Bi was really close at hand. Looking at each other in a mess, it is difficult to blame until death. There are many heartbreaks when walking, and there is no comfort when going out. Yu Gong shoulders his righteousness, and his head turns white with melancholy."

Jiannan's time is immeasurable, and Biantou Gongqing is still arrogant. It's a battle to take care of appeasement, and fat meat and drunkards want it. Huh, the ancients have already lost their dung, and only those with lofty ideals are willing to fish and woodcutters. What's more, I'm wandering around without a fixed place, and I live in pain and suffering all day long. Autumn stays in Shuangxi, the prime moon is high, and I am happy to talk to Zichang at night. Traveling east and west is still exhausting, so what will happen to me from now on. The root of Zhizi pine grows Poria cocos, and Chi Mu intends to cook it together."

The Bian Pavilion bleeds into sea water, and the Emperor Wu has no intention of opening the Bian Pavilion. Don't you hear that the Han family has two hundred prefectures in Shandong, and there are thousands of villages and thousands of villages where Jingqi grows. Even if there are healthy women who hoe and plow, there will be nothing in the long acres of hay. What's more, Qin's soldiers fought hard and were driven out like dogs and chickens.

The number of guards is real, and there is a little bit of its name. Chicory pricks like needles, and horse teeth leaves are also numerous. Green and green, buried in the middle garden. The officials in the garden are not to be blamed, but the world is solid. Woohoo battles have been going on for a long time, and the thorns are dark in Changyuan.

As soon as I heard that I was in a hurry, I turned my worries to the younger generation. The sharp ears on the head criticize autumn bamboo, and the high hoof cuts cold jade under the feet. Only then did I know that there is a different kind of dragon, not more fleshy than the common horse. The Luoyang Avenue is clear again, and I am happy to go eastward after a long day.

Monk Guang in Kuxian County has a strong bone, his books are expensive, thin and hard, and he can reach the gods. It's a pity that Li Cai is no longer available. My nephew Li Chao wrote a kiss. Shangshu Han Zemu rides Cao Cai Youjie. Kaiyuan has come to count eight points, and Chao also has two sons and three people. Kuang Chao Xiaozhuan forces Qin Xiang, and the fast sword and long halberd face each other. Eight cents a word is worth a hundred gold, and the dragon plate takes the meat to bend the wall.

There are more than an hectare of bamboo, and the trees are towering. Rhododendron arrives in late spring, mourning and whining. I often pay homage to the ancient emperor's soul. When a child is born to a hundred birds' nests, all birds dare not be angry. Still feeding his son, the courtesy is like serving the Supreme. The swan goose and the lamb are polite and courteous before ancient times. Flying and kneeling breasts, knowing the order is like knowing grace. The ancient rules of sages and sages are handed down to future generations. When you look at the love of birds and birds, you still understand the cuckoo. It's late spring today, and I've been sick for years. I can't worship when I'm sick, and my tears are like springs."
现实,杜甫,杜鹃行,唐,君不见昔日蜀天子，化作杜鹃似老乌。寄巢生子不自啄，群鸟至今与哺雏。虽同君臣有旧礼，骨肉满眼身羁孤。业工窜伏深树里，四月五月偏号呼。其声哀痛口流血，所诉何事常区区。尔岂摧残始发愤，羞带羽翮伤形愚。苍天变化谁料得，万事反覆何所无。万事反覆何所无，岂忆当殿群臣趋。,Reality,Du Fu,Rhododendron line,"Don't you see that the emperor of Shu in the past turned into a cuckoo like a cuckoo. They don't peck their own nests to give birth to children, and the birds are still nursing their young. Although there are old rituals with the monarch and ministers, the flesh and blood are full of eyes and body. Industrial workers hide in deep trees, howling in April and May. His voice was mournful and his mouth was bleeding, and what he was complaining about was always mere. You don't want to be angry when you destroy it, and you are ashamed to wear feathers to hurt your shape and stupidity. Unexpected changes in the sky, everything repeats itself, nothing happens. There is nothing to repeat everything, how can you remember that the officials in the palace are tending."
现实,杜甫,杜鹃行,唐,古时杜宇称望帝，魂作杜鹃何微细。跳枝窜叶树木中，抢佯瞥捩雌随雄。毛衣惨黑貌憔悴，众鸟安肯相尊崇。隳形不敢栖华屋，短翮唯愿巢深丛。穿皮啄朽觜欲秃，苦饥始得食一虫。谁言养雏不自哺，此语亦足为愚蒙。声音咽咽如有谓，号啼略与婴儿同。口乾垂血转迫促，似欲上诉于苍穹。蜀人闻之皆起立，至今敩学传遗风。乃知变化不可穷，岂知昔日居深宫，嫔嫱左右如花红。,Reality,Du Fu,Rhododendron line,"In ancient times, Du Yu was called Wangdi, and his soul was Dujuan He Weiwei. Jumping branches and leaves among the trees, grabbing a glimpse of the female and following the male. The sweater is dark and haggard, and all the birds respect each other. The shape of the cockroach does not dare to live in a Chinese house, but the short heap only wishes to nest deep in the bushes. Piercing the skin and pecking at the rotten scorpion, wanting to be bald, only to eat a worm when suffering from hunger. Whoever says that rearing young is not self-feeding is also foolish enough to say this. The sound of swallowing and swallowing is like that, and the howling is slightly the same as that of a baby. The mouth is dry and the blood is bleeding, and it seems to want to appeal to the sky. The Shu people all stood up when they heard it, and they have passed on the tradition to this day. I know that changes are endless, but I don't know that in the past, I lived in a deep palace, and my concubines were like bonuses."

Minggong published this picture, but nothing passed on its shape. Different postures are independent, clear and purposeful. Improperly banning a thousand-mile horse, angering thousands of generals. Recalling the Lishan Palace in the past, the winter shift contains the Yuan battle. Tianhan Dayu hunting, this thing is the king of gods. At that time, there were no ordinary materials, and all of them were strong. The powder and ink are similar in shape, and those who know it feel melancholy. In the holidays with few fights, the real bones are old cliffs. To get rid of the cunning rabbit for the king, it will be turned over."

Long Mei used to be born in Wowa, and his sweat and blood are now dedicated here. There are three thousand horses in the garden, and the grass is green and cold and never dies. There is no food in the Western Regions, and the horses are crowned and humble every year. Wang Youhuchen Siyuanmen, the entrance to the Tianshang is all Yuntun. A single bone of the concubine is the emperor alone, and it belongs to the Supreme in the Spring and Autumn Period. The supremacy is that the internal and external horses have a surplus of billions, and there are huge deposits in the sky. Yiqun is extremely trustworthy and outstanding, but it is difficult to say how suave and powerful. There are many piles of riches and Tibetans rushing forward, and Potuo often surpasses them. The horns are strong and they swim with the elk, and the floating body shakes the turtle cave. The giant fish from the spring is longer than a human being, and the cinnabar is the golden scale of the tail. Unexpectedly, the foreign matter is the same as the essence, even if he has not become a dragon, he still has a spirit."

Children's play on the left and right banks, Kwu and Yi complete the support. Overturn the lotus chaos, and command the fans of the path. The scales of the fish have been cut, and the lotus root is picked without washing the mud. Human feelings are delicious, and things are cheap. My village is beautiful and beautiful, and the chickens in different houses also live there. What is the right place to be depressed? There is no source.

Gongqing's Zhumen is not unlocked, and I, Cao, are shoulder-to-shoulder. My brother sleeps soundly to relax his knees, without socks or towels to step on the dawn.

After the great sage, the mausoleum was late, and the mighty ancient and modern are one. Compared with forty uncles, there are hundreds of talents but no life. Today, there are a hundred brothers, and a few of them are outstanding in following Zhou etiquette. In Ru, I will use the article as the elder brother Baimei to restore the apocalypse. Rumen, please tell us from Zeng Weng, how cleverly the Empress Dowager was in power. In the last years of Duke Di's administration, the turbid river did not pollute the clean economy. At the beginning of the country's heir, he will put it into military use, and the public will guard Danbi alone in the court. Fangling was invited for the decision of the ban, and the elders of the previous dynasty all shed tears. Once Taizong Sheji was upright, the majesty of the Han Palace was restored. When the time is dangerous, you don't know the talents of the world. Who says that the bitterness and sweetness are like shepherds. Rucao is also suitable for food from the soil, and the body makes the door more colorful. Hu Wei wandered between the Min and Han Dynasties, and paid a visit to the princes and princes quite often.

A thousand miles away is still old ice and snow, and a hundred pots will try to open their arms. The old man hears the war drums and mourns, and he is anxious to relieve his worries. The young man tried his best to talk and laugh, and I described him as haggard. Xue Hua is good at singing drunk while sitting, and the lyrics are old-fashioned. Recently, there are long sentences in the country, Ru and Shandong Li Bai are good. He, Liu, Shen, Xie Li did not work, and Bao Zhao, both talented and worried, fell to the ground. All life is full of new knowledge and joy, and everything will eventually hurt you and you will not be able to protect yourself.

The daily supply is in the military reserve, and the Shangguan supervises and has divisions. Gao Xian is in a difficult situation, so he has no time to support him. Tired and struggling with strategies, there is nothing to do with living debris. The former king really sinned against himself, and his sorrow is hereby. The years are not with me, and the time is wasted and sick. Look at the atmosphere of Fengcheng at night, and look back at Jiaolongchi. The tooth hair has already been expected, and the bitter words are deeply meaningful."
现实,杜甫,咏怀二首 其二,唐,邦危坏法则，圣远益愁慕。飘飖桂水游，怅望苍梧暮。潜鱼不衔钩，走鹿无反顾。皦皦幽旷心，拳拳异平素。衣食相拘阂，朋知限流寓。风涛上春沙，千里侵江树。逆行少吉日，时节空复度。井灶任尘埃，舟航烦数具。牵缠加老病，琐细隘俗务。万古一死生，胡为足名数。多忧污桃源，拙计泥铜柱。未辞炎瘴毒，摆落跋涉惧。虎狼窥中原，焉得所历住。葛洪及许靖，避世常此路。贤愚诚等差，自爱各驰骛。羸瘠且如何，魄夺针灸屡。拥滞僮仆慵，稽留篙师怒。终当挂帆席，天意难告诉。南为祝融客，勉强亲杖屦。结托老人星，罗浮展衰步。,Reality,Du Fu,Yonghuai Two Poems,"The state is in danger and the laws are broken, and Shengyuan is more and more envious. Floating in the osmanthus and swimming in the water, looking at the evening of Cangwu. Diving fish without hook, walking deer without turning back. The heart is quiet and open, and the fist is different from usual. Food and clothing are constrained, and friends and friends are limited. The wind and waves go up the spring sand and invade the trees of the river for thousands of miles. Retrograde less auspicious days, time and space are repeated. The well stove is full of dust, and the boat and boat are troubled by several. Entanglement adds to old age and sickness, trivial and narrow mundane affairs. For thousands of years, Hu is the number one. Worry about the pollution of the Taoyuan, and the humble plan of the mud and copper pillars. The poison of inflammation and miasma has not been dismissed, and the fear of trekking has been shaken off. Tigers and wolves peek at the Central Plains, how can they get what they live. Ge Hong and Xu Jing escaped the world and often traveled this way. The virtuous, the foolish, and the sincere are equally poor, and each loves his own. Lean barren and how, soul wins acupuncture and moxibustion repeatedly. The servants of the children are lazy, and the masters are angry when they stay behind. In the end, when the sail is hung, God's will is hard to tell. The south is a guest of Zhu Rong, and he barely kisses the staff. With the support of Canopus, Luofu will show its decline."
现实,杜甫,垂老别,唐,四郊未宁静，垂老不得安。子孙阵亡尽，焉用身独完。投杖出门去，同行为辛酸。幸有牙齿存，所悲骨髓乾。男儿既介胄，长揖别上官。老妻卧路啼，岁暮衣裳单。孰知是死别，且复伤其寒。此去必不归，还闻劝加餐。土门壁甚坚，杏园度亦难。势异邺城下，纵死时犹宽。人生有离合，岂择衰老端。忆昔少壮日，迟回竟长叹。万国尽征戍，烽火被冈峦。积尸草木腥，流血川原丹。何乡为乐土，安敢尚盘桓。弃绝蓬室居，塌然摧肺肝。,Reality,Du Fu,old man,"The surrounding suburbs are not peaceful, and the elderly are restless. The children and grandchildren are all killed in battle, how can they die alone. Throwing the stick and going out, the behavior of the peers is bitter. Fortunately, the teeth are preserved, but the bone marrow is dry. The man is a gentleman, so he bows to the official. The old wife is lying on the road and crying, and the clothes are single at the end of the year. Who knows it's a farewell, and it's cold again. If you go here, you will never return, and you will be advised to add another meal. The wall of the earth gate is very strong, and it is difficult to survive the apricot orchard. The situation is different under the city of Ye, and it is still wide when you die. There are separations and reunions in life, how can we choose the aging end. Reminiscing about the days when I was young and strong, I sighed when I returned late. Ten thousand countries are conquered, and the beacon fire is surrounded by hills and mountains. The dead bodies are smelly, and Kawahara Dan is bleeding. He Xiang is a happy land, An Dare to still Panhuan. Abandoning tents and dwellings will destroy the lungs and liver."
现实,杜甫,夜归,唐,夜来归来冲虎过，山黑家中已眠卧。傍见北斗向江低，仰看明星当空大。庭前把烛嗔两炬，峡口惊猿闻一个。白头老罢舞复歌，杖藜不睡谁能那。,Reality,Du Fu,return at night,"Come back at night and pass by the tiger, Shanhei's house is already sleeping. Seeing the Big Dipper low to the river by the side, looking up at the stars in the sky. Before the court, two candles were burned, and the mouth of the gorge was startled by the sound of one. The white-headed old man stops dancing and sings again, who can do that if the stick is not sleeping."
现实,杜甫,夜听许十损诵诗爱而有作,唐,许生五台宾，业白出石壁。余亦师粲可，身犹缚禅寂。何阶子方便，谬引为匹敌。离索晚相逢，包蒙欣有击。诵诗浑游衍，四座皆辟易。应手看捶钩，清心听鸣镝。精微穿溟涬，飞动摧霹雳。陶谢不枝梧，风骚共推激。紫燕自超诣，翠駮谁剪剔。君意人莫知，人间夜寥阒。,Reality,Du Fu,Listening to Xu Shishang at night reciting poems about love and writing,"Xu gave birth to five guests, and his business came out of the stone wall. Yu Yishi is brilliant, but his body is still bound to Zen silence. He Jiezi is convenient, and he is falsely cited as a match. When Li Suo met later, Bao Mengxin was shocked. Reciting poems in the Qing Dynasty and traveling in Yan, all four of them were changed. Look at the hammer with your hands, and listen to the sound of dysprosium with a pure heart. The subtle pierces the dark, and the flying destroys the thunderbolt. Tao Xie Bu Zhiwu, coquettish and coquettish. The Ziyan is self-superior, but the Cuihe will cut it. You don't know what you want, and the world is lonely at night."
现实,杜甫,夜闻觱篥,唐,夜闻觱篥沧江上，衰年侧耳情所向。邻舟一听多感伤，塞曲三更歘悲壮。积雪飞霜此夜寒，孤灯急管复风湍。君知天地干戈满，不见江湖行路难。,Reality,Du Fu,night smell,"At night, I heard that the river is on the Cangjiang River, and the old man's ear is full of love. Neighbor Zhou was very sad when he heard it, and the third watch of Sequ was tragic. The night is cold with snow and frost, and the lonely lamp is in a hurry to return to the wind. You know that the world is full of wars, and it is difficult to see the rivers and lakes."
现实,杜甫,奉先刘少府新画山水障歌,唐,堂上不合生枫树，怪底江山起烟雾。闻君埽却赤县图，乘兴谴画沧洲趣。画师亦无数，好手不可遇。对此融心神，知君重毫素。岂但祁岳与郑虔，笔迹远过杨契丹。得非悬圃裂，无乃潇湘翻。悄然坐我天姥下，耳边已似闻清猿。反思前夜风雨急，乃是蒲城鬼神人。元气淋漓障犹湿，真宰上诉天应泣。野亭春还杂花远，渔翁暝蹋孤舟立。沧浪水深青溟阔，攲岸侧岛秋毫末。不见湘妃鼓瑟时，至今斑竹临江活。刘侯天机精，爱画入骨髓。自有两儿郎，挥洒亦莫比。大儿聪明到，能添老树巅崖里。小儿心孔开，貌得山僧及童子。若耶溪，云门寺。吾独胡为在泥滓，青鞋布袜从此始。,Reality,Du Fu,Fengxian Liu Shaofu's new painting landscape barrier song,"There are no maple trees growing in the hall, and there is smoke from the mountains and rivers at the bottom. Hearing the map of Chixian County, I am full of interest in painting Cangzhou. There are also countless painters, and it is hard to meet a good one. In this regard, the mind is in harmony, and you know how important you are. Not only Qi Yue and Zheng Qian's handwriting far surpassed Yang Qidan's. It is not the crack of the hanging garden, but the turning of Xiaoxiang. Sitting quietly under my grandma, I seem to hear the ape clearly in my ears. Reflecting on the stormy night before, it was the ghosts and gods in Pucheng. The vitality is dripping and the obstacle is still wet, and Zhenzai appeals to the heavens to cry. The spring in the wild pavilion is still far away with mixed flowers, and the fisherman stands alone in a lonely boat. The water in the Canglang is deep and green, and the island on the side of the bank is at the end of autumn. When the Concubine Xiang was not seen playing the zither, Banzhu is still alive in Linjiang. Liu Hou is a master of secrets, and loves painting to the bone marrow. If you have your own son, it's better to be swayed. Da'er is so smart that he can add to the old tree and the cliff. The child's heart is open, and he looks like a mountain monk and a boy. Ruoye River, Yunmen Temple. I am alone in the mud, and the green shoes and tabby socks start from here."

The king will come in October, and the feathers will come to Kyushu. The yin fire boils Yuquan, sprays thin rocks and secluded. Sometimes bathing in the red sun, the light hugs the air. Langfeng enters the ruts, Kuangyuan Yanming searches. Boiling sky, ten thousand rides, watching the water, Baizhang Qiu. The ghost Si Kejia belongs to Xiu in Wang Ming Palace. At the beginning, I heard that the dragon used to be strong, broke the stone and destroyed the forest and hills. The renovation of Zhongye Grotto house was due to wind, rain and autumn. The shadow of the Yaochi hangs upside down, and the bend pours into the Cangjiang River. The taste is like nectar pulp, smooth and soft. The green flag is slow and slow, and the clouds and cars are rarely left. The flutes and drums sway all over the world, with a strange fragrance. The merman offered a little silk, and once wished Shen Haoniu. Baixiang rushed to the prosperous Ming Dynasty, and there was nothing in the past. Putuo golden toad, there is a reason to go out and see. Supreme Gu Zhixiao, but the Queen Mother refused to accept it. Return to nothingness and bottomless, and turn into a long yellow qiu. Piao Piao Qing Suo Lang, literary talent coral hook. The great song Lushui song makes the listener feel sad."
现实,杜甫,奉送魏六丈佑少府之交广,唐,贤豪赞经纶，功成空名垂。子孙不振耀，历代皆有之。郑公四叶孙，长大常苦饥。众中见毛骨，犹是麒麟儿。磊落贞观事，致君朴直词。家声盖六合，行色何其微。遇我苍吾阴，忽惊会面稀。议论有馀地，公侯来未迟。虚思黄金贵，自笑青云期。长卿久病渴，武帝元同时。季子黑貂敝，得无妻嫂欺。尚为诸侯客，独屈州县卑。南游炎海甸，浩荡从此辞。穷途仗神道，世乱轻土宜。解帆岁云暮，可与春风归。出入朱门家，华屋刻蛟螭。玉食亚王者，乐张游子悲。侍婢艳倾城，绡绮轻雾霏。掌中琥珀钟，行酒双逶迤。新欢继明烛，梁栋星辰飞。两情顾盼合，珠碧赠于斯。上贵见肝胆，下贵不相疑。心事披写间，气酣达所为。错挥铁如意，莫避珊瑚枝。始兼逸迈兴，终慎宾主仪。戎马闇天宇，呜呼生别离。,Reality,Du Fu,"As a gift to Wei Liuzhang, the friend of the Shaofu","Xianhao praises economics, and his success is empty. Children and grandchildren do not shine, and it has happened in all dynasties. Zheng Gong's four-leaf grandson grew up often suffering from hunger. If you see hairy bones in the crowd, it's still a unicorn. Watch things openly and honestly, and express your sincere words to you. The voice of the family covers the heaven and earth, but the behavior is so subtle. Meet me Cang Wuyin, suddenly surprised to meet rare. There is room for discussion, and it is not too late for the Duke to come. Thinking about gold is precious, laughing at yourself in the Qingyun period. Changqing was sick and thirsty for a long time, and Emperor Wu and Yuan were at the same time. Jizi sable is poor, so he has no wife and sister-in-law to deceive. He is still a guest of the princes, but Quzhou and counties are humble. Traveling south to Yanhaidian, the mighty resigned from now on. Poor roads rely on the way of God, and the chaos of the world is light on the land. When Xie Fan is old and cloudy, he can return with the spring breeze. Going in and out of Zhumen's house, the Huawu is carved with Jiaochi. Jade eats the sub-king, happy Zhang Youzi is sad. The servant girl is alluring, and the silk is light and misty. The amber clock in the palm of the hand, the two winds of wine. The new love follows the bright candle, and the stars fly in Liang Dong. The two loves look forward to being together, and Zhubi is given to Sri Lanka. The upper one sees the liver and gallbladder, but the lower one does not believe it. In the writing room of my heart, I am full of energy. If you swing iron by mistake, don't avoid coral branches. At the beginning, it is both Yimaixing, and in the end, it is cautious about guests and hosts. Soldiers and horses darken the sky, whirring and parting."

There is a good bird in the west, and it will play Qingming for me. The feathers are pure white snow, and Fei Yunting is dismal. After receiving the care of the master, he raised the hen to call the lonely pavilion. Hold to compare Jiashi, and this is to comfort and praise. The Qing Dynasty moved mourning jade, and seeing the Tao made a new heart. If you want to learn from Yizi, wait for Le Yanshan Ming. Whoever breaks the snake sword again, the king has not heard. The ambition is in the Kirin Pavilion, but the mica screen is unintentional. The Zhuo family is a widow and a wealthy family. Xiangru is talented, and Yinhan will be a double star. Guests come to wash the powder, and the sunset picks up the fireflies. It's not that there is no tuition fee, I advise Lang to work hard on the Six Classics. The old man drew the stream by himself, and the wild water was cold every day. I sigh that the black head is white, but you see the silver seal is blue. Knowing mountain ghosts while sick, knowing the terrain for farmers. Whoever sits in the brocade tent is tired of eating fish. On both sides of the east and west banks, horizontal water pours into the sea. The blue color is suddenly melancholy, and the wind and thunder search for the lark. The white tiger is on the right in the air, and Pingting is attracted by the red knot. From the daughter of Emperor Yundi, she is the phoenix feather in the rain. King Xiang is thin on his whereabouts, so don't learn to be as cold as Ding. After Qianqiu wiped away her tears, she felt slightly sweet in her dream. Touched by each other in life, gold and stone are green friends. The father-in-law just sits in peace, don't distinguish between Wei and Jing. Dragons and snakes still fight, spilling blood in the dark suburbs. I have heard that the wise master uses light punishments in governing the country. Selling soldiers and casting agricultural equipment, Fang Ning is old and new. King Wen was frugal and virtuous, and Jun Yi began to fill the court.

The father-in-law tried to listen quietly, and the humble son asked for a statement. In the past, when I was a teenager, I was already a state guest. Reading break rolls, getting a God. Fu material Yang Xiong enemy, poetry to see sons and relatives. Li Yong asked for acquaintance, and Wang Han wished to make a neighbor. Claiming to be quite outstanding, Li Deng asked for Lu Jin. To Jun Yao and Shun, let the customs be pure. This meaning is actually depressed, and the singing is not hidden. Thirty years of riding a donkey, traveling and eating in Jinghuachun. Lock the door of the rich in the morning, and follow the fat horse dust in the evening. Remnant cups and cold burns are everywhere. When the Lord saw the sign, he suddenly wanted to stretch out. Qing Ming hangs down her wings, but she has no vertical scales. I am ashamed that my father-in-law is thick, but I know that my father-in-law is true. Every time on Bailiao, new good sentences are recited obscenely. Stealing and imitating Gonggong is happy, but it is difficult to be willing to be poor. How can I feel dispirited, I just walk around. Now I want to enter the sea in the east, and I am about to go to Qin in the west. I still pity Zhongnan Mountain, looking back at Weibin in Qing Dynasty. I often plan to report a meal, and Kuang Huai resigns to the minister. The white gull is not mighty, no one can tame it."

Difficult body is precious, I dare to take lengthy. It's just a test, and it's more durable. Discuss the facts and solve the problems, and the operations are handy.

Get rid of Fenxi fishing, and manage Ying Jiangjin. Now that Yunxiao is under pressure, who is more dear to Tai Gun. The chicks in Fengxue are all good, and the customers of Longmen are new. The righteous voices are grateful, and the failures are self-defeating. Where do you want to go, the sky is high and it is difficult to repeat. Studying poetry is like a child, and reading a guest in the hometown. You can't be the same as Chao Cuo, but you will complain after you sigh. Ji Shu suspects calligraphy, and time passes by recalling Songyun. Present to the family members of the emperor, and pay homage to Zichen in the middle. And with Zhu Yanji, Fang Kai is thin and talented. Breaking the courage to encounter the former government, the conspiracy alone Bingjun.

Although relying on the third order, I will worry about the overthrow of all nations. I can't wait to lead the train to death, but I am very kind when I slip through the net. I will cry forever in the Han court, and pity the soul of Xiangshui from afar. Jiang Jian, a poor winter guest, always has a pastoral garden.

Nine temples were burned at midnight, and Yun Han became popular. Unraveling the tiles and flying ten miles, the spikes and curtains were once empty. Guilty and pity for the tree owner, one by one gray and sad. A row of iron cavalry in the evening, and a loose brocade at the dawn of the Qing Dynasty? The thieves congratulate each other on their success. At that time, the concubines were slaughtered, and they were even piles of dung. Dang Ning fell into the jade seat, and the painting insects were peeled off in the white space. I don't know the two holy places, sobbing privately for a hundred-year-old man. The car is driving and the clouds are returning, and the couplets are worshiping. Therefore, the old man returned to Tisi, and the temple official tree and chair tree. The grandeur is not as good as before, and Di Lixiong has been seen. In the suburban temple of the former Spring Festival, sacrifices are made to the saints. The small body is close to the ministers, and Jing Cong accompanies the group. Climb the steps and hold the jade book, and the crown of the eunuch is the golden bell. The ancestral temple is first exposed, and the tucked gate is near the dragon. The son of heaven is filial to his grandson, and five clouds rise from nine. Changing the dowry in the mirror for powder and Dai, the emerald feathers are still hazy. The former hated Jie Hu, and later suffered from Quan Rong. Zu tofu and mutton meat, 罘罳 line horn bow. Ande comes from the West Pole, and Deuteronomy empty Shandong. As far as the body is concerned, the scholars and common people are in the middle of the pass. The main general Xiao Nishun, Yuan Yuan returns to the end. Once you sin against yourself, you will be able to read books for thousands of miles. Feng Dy is used for hoeing and plowing, and the garrison is obeyed. The redundant officials resumed their jobs, and the natives returned to farming. The monarchs and ministers are frugal, and the government and the people cheer together. Zhongxing is like the beginning of the country, and the successor is like Taizong. Duan Gong accepts remonstrance and admonition, and the wind and the sun blend together. Chichi cherry branches, hidden in silver cages. The mausoleum recommended by Qianchun will last forever. The capital is no longer on fire, and Jingwei looks sad. Return to the name of the old pines and cypresses, and grow old and suffer."

The jade coffin has gone up to the sky, and the day is still silent. Evening rises to Gen Cen's top, but the towel is still there. Four or five disciples came in and shed tears. In the rest of my time, I traveled to famous mountains and started in Yuanhe. The good-looking face violated the long-cherished wish, with a sad look. Lin Hun dismissed the quiet chime, and actually lay down on the stone pavilion at night. Wang Qiao went down to the Temple of Heaven, the faint moon reflected the bright crane. The morning creek goes to Xuyun, and it has been yesterday to return to the path. Why don't you say goodbye to the green shoes and calluses, and look forward to the golden dagger medicine. Dongmeng went to the old hermit, still remembering the joy of comrades. Mr. Dong, who has retired, is now alone. Hu is a guest, and his morality has been weakened for a long time. Who is the wife? Dansha bears the promise. Although the grief has changed, I am not worried about the weakness of the muscles.

In the cold and overcast Jieshi, thousands of miles of wind and cloud come. Sang Zhe's leaves are like rain, and they fly to Pei Hui. The frost is clear and the lake is frozen, and the animals are sad. It's time when the warehouse is real, and the cave is open. The warrior wants to destroy the Hu, and the general looks at the three platforms. The king has no regrets and controls the heroes. Youyan prospers in using force, and supplies are also laborious. Wumen turned millet and silk, Pan Hailing Penglai. Eat 300,000 meat, hunt and shoot yellow ai. Looking back across the river, the youth has been destroyed. It is not as good as the boy's day, and there is no cup for the deceased. Writing poems alone sheds tears, thinking about talented people in troubled times. There is a strong bone in the city, don't hate the little dragon matchmaker. Shangshan discusses gains and losses, and the Lord of Shu is free from suspicion. Lu Shang was granted the title of Guoyi, and Fu said that he had already salted plums. Jingyan Chu Mountain is deep, and the water crane goes low and returns. Mr. Pang is in charge of his nature, and he takes his son to lie on the moss."

God hurts the mountains and travels deep, worrying about the ancient temples on the cliffs. Chanjuanbi is fresh and clean, and Xiao is cold and sheaths gather together. Back to the mountain root water, slowly pine rain. In the early morning, the clouds are released, and the first day is cloudy and vomits again. Zhu Zong is half-lighted, and households can be counted. I forgot the early stage of Zhu policy, and it was noon when the radish came out. The rules of Mingming are called, and the micro-paths will not be taken again."
现实,杜甫,泥功山,唐,朝行青泥上，暮在青泥中。泥泞非一时，版筑劳人功。不畏道途永，乃将汨没同。白马为铁骊，小儿成老翁。哀猿透却坠，死鹿力所穷。寄语北来人，后来莫悤悤。,Reality,Du Fu,Ni Gong Shan,"On the green mud in the morning, in the blue mud in the evening. The mud is not for a while, and the construction of the plate is a laborious effort. Don't be afraid of the road and the way forever, but will not be the same.

There is no convulsion in the first shock, why stand abruptly. I know that the painter is wonderful, and he has successfully scraped the cave of creation. The handsomeness of the writing is full of the eyes of the king. Birds and magpies are all over the branches, and they are afraid of them coming out. Looking sideways at Qingxiao, I would rather die than all the birds. Chang He is like a sword, which can be surpassed in the world. The universe is empty and majestic, and the pink and ink are bleak. Thinking about clouds and sand, it has its own smoky quality. What hurts me now, Gu Bu is alone and depressed."

Under the water and light of the trees, everything is in the clouds. What you think is hindering your actions, and you can't believe it for nine miles. Quietly and plainly travel the road, all the way to the east of the sky. I would like to ride a six-foot horse, and my back is like a lonely Zhenghong. Seeing the young master later, he smiled aloofly. Hu Yue, who was flying hard, was cramped and hurt the cage. Four or five times a meal, Ping Xuan was poor. Jia vegetables are not turbid, when the chrysanthemum is broken and hazel bushes. Falcons are also bent fiercely, so why are Wuyuan so bewitched. The style is to look at the neighbors in the north, and to choose the Weng in the South Lane. How can you know the end of the Qing Dynasty when you hang up the seats and catch the river rising?"

Mao Fei crosses the river and sprinkles the suburbs of the river. The taller ones hang on the tops of long forests, and the lower ones float around Shentangao. The Nancun group of children bullied me to be old and weak, and I could bear to be a thief. I openly hold thatch into the bamboo, my lips are scorched and my mouth is dry, I can't breathe, and I sigh when I return, leaning on my stick. The wind in Russia makes the clouds dark, and the autumn is dark. The cloth quilt has been cold as iron for many years, and Jiao'er is lying on the ground and cracking. There is nothing to do in the bed, the house leaks, and the rain is like hemp. Since I have lost my sleep and lack of sleep, why do I get wet all night long? There are tens of thousands of mansions in Ande, which shelters all poor people in the world and is as safe as a mountain. Alas! When I suddenly see this house in front of my eyes, it is enough for my house to be broken and frozen to death."

Dongting Yangbo Jianghan Hui, the tiger teeth and copper pillars are tilted. Wu Gorge is cloudy and deserted, and the peaks and valleys are dark. The cuckoo does not come, the ape is cold, and the mountain ghost is worried about the snow and frost. The old man of Chu groaned in memory of miasma, and his three-foot horn bow was two dendrobium. The stone city is erected on the wall, and the golden flag is full of clouds. Yuyang suddenly rides and hunts Qingqiu, and the dog and armor hear Danji. Eight years of anti-thieves, conquering and punishing widows to cry, and tears in the eyes of distant guests."

Crying and crying to the ground, in order to ask who is the driver. The phoenix comes from the east, why do you want to fly high again?

This summer, the vegetation grows, so I have to go west. The hemp shoes meet the emperor, and the sleeves show two elbows. The imperial court min survived, and the old ugly was injured by relatives. Tears and tears are given to the relics, and the Lord is kind and generous. Although Caimen had to go, he opened his mouth before he could bear it. Send a letter to ask Sanchuan if he is home. Biwen Tong suffered a disaster and killed chickens and dogs. If there is a leaky hut in the mountains, who will return to the household. The roots of the pine trees are destroyed, and the bones of the ground are not rotten. How can a few people live together with each other in the whole room? Huan Cen Tiger Field, Yu Jie back to my head. It has been October since I sent a book. There is nothing wrong with the news of anti-fear.

Visiting Peishizhou in the south, there is no danger of Qihe. Climbing the hanging tree, climbing into the sky rock. The green hills flow from the river, and the city walls wash away the sorrows and sorrows. Listening to my son's words about this country makes me happy. Its vulgarity is simple, and it does not know that there is a subject and an object. Warm the princes' gates, and the etiquette is the same as in the past. The imperial cook is very ashamed, and the cups and plates are quite messy. Although it is a time of mourning and chaos, things are more expensive than rewards. It's a nice meeting at mid-night, and Pei Zheng is not a distant relative. There are 10,000 volumes of books in the group, and they are involved in the service gap. In the future, silver hooks will be humiliated, and spears and halberds will be seen in the forest. Daoyi is happy to return, and draw the land to ask for the experience.

The previous rain was violent, but today's rain is easy. There must be thunder, and the wind will increase. The good sound reaches the middle of the night, and the expectations are the same. In the frosty September sky, it seems to see stagnant ears. The suburban door and my private, my garden is green day by day. Hate that there is no strength to embrace, and the concubine will reduce the cost of Linjiang."

Depressed to go out to travel, Kuangjue eye interest. Dissipate the sun and lie down on the pillow, lie down for a long time in the dust and scorpion. How can there be no public opinion on the shoulders, and you can't distinguish the road to the countryside. Bing Gehao did not stop, snakes turned to look at each other. The moon is broken, and the year is gloomy. Acupuncture and moxibustion hinder friends and cao, and chaff is against children and children. One life must be changed, and new knowledge will gradually become old. Poverty and desolation benefit inferiority complex, whoever wants to complain when wandering. If you are worried about answering, Russia may violate the advance. There are so many vulgarities, and you people are unique. Duke Pang went alone, and Shangzi rarely met. Stay in Dongting in autumn, the weather is cold and Xiaoxiangsu. The stick policy can be put into the boat, and the tooth will be sent to twilight."

Its skin is severely cut and peeled, and it is perishable even though it is numerous. The cloth is like clouds and leaves, blue and yellow after the cold. Cross the cross to gather the ax and catty, and the willow willows first wither. When injured, the army is exhausted, and officials take everything. Ye Erjiang Han people, what is the natural recovery. There is the same dead palm tree, which made me sigh for a long time. The dead are rested, how can the living guard themselves. Tweeting and chirping the oriole, I saw Han Peng walking away from the side. Nian Er works like a shadow, destroying no weeds."

I don't know how old it is, and there is no business. The upper branch touches the emperor's sky, and the lower root pans thickly. Huge surrounding thunderbolts, thousands of insects and ants gather. The freezing rain falls and the glue flows, and the wind wins the spirit. The white swan didn't come, and the chicken was worried. It still contains pillars and tools, but there is no resurgence of Hanzhi. Good work has been rare in the past, and those who know it shed tears. It is not easy to grow elm in the middle of the water. Cut off the golden dew plate, curl up without fear."

There are fallen wings under the forest, and there are no boats in the water. There are thousands of rooms, but the place is closed, and personnel affairs are closed. The old man is not happy, and his trips are also full of worries. Vipers die in the evening, and it is difficult to cast in secret on an empty bed. Yanxiao hates bright candles, and the situation is nostalgic hills. Open the front and look up to the brother-in-law, holding the heat and showing the white head. The belt has a negative thorn, and the connection becomes a hindrance to repair. He Dang Qingshuangfei, meeting son Linjiang Tower. Hearing about the great Yi Yi, satirizes the family of poets. Inheriting the generation of different times, prosecuting oneself is not a matter of seeking. The emperor's envoy body, the letter is the virtue and the career. Chucai chose Qizi, and Hanyuan returned to Hualiu. The short chapter reaches my heart, and the reason is raised for those who know."

It's time for two or three heroes to come out, and it's time to rectify the world. Walking east, I can't recall the perch, and flying south, I feel that there are nesting birds. Youth comes back with the crown, and the Forbidden City is surrounded by fireworks. The crane is forbidden to pass through the sky and the phoenix is prepared, and the rooster crows to ask for the dawn of the sleeping dragon tower. Climbing the dragon and attaching the phoenix is irresistible, and the world will become a prince. Do you know that Meng Dili is not allowed to boast of physical strength. Prime Minister Xiao stayed in Guanzhong, and Zhang Zifang was reused under the curtain. Mr. Zhang was a Jianghai guest all his life. He is nine feet tall and has a beard and eyebrows. It is only when we meet the situation that we will meet the situation, we will know how to make good plans when we help Britain. What's more, the white horse in the green robe, the later Han Dynasty will be prosperous again this week. Every inch of land and sky are paid tribute, and the strange auspiciousness and auspiciousness are contended to send them off.

Sa Ran spirits together, why bother autumn Suitong. The pavilion is newly made up, and the dragon's driving gear has been empty. The world is also for you, please let the children go. It is said that the family is rich and frugal, and the white house is the Dagong Palace. The dining husband Yitang hall, Mingyu's desolate room. Expose clothes all over the world, dragging the moon and raising the breeze. The spider silk is like a little man, and it is embroidered in melons and fruits. The first feast is full of dew, and the sunrise is sweet. I regret that you are an unmarried daughter, and my heart is full of depression. Self-defense moves like a law, try your best to hit the target. Although there is no aunt or uncle, I dare to weave meritorious service. It is clear that the deeds of the monarch and his ministers are close at hand or not allowed. There is no abandonment of righteousness and etiquette, and Enshi and his wife are respectful. There is a good time for the young and the big, and it is up to the public to abstain. There are many quarrels in Fangyuan, and many husbands are heroes."
现实,杜甫,相逢歌赠严二别驾,唐,我行入东川，十步一回首。城都乱罢气萧飒，浣花草堂亦何有。梓中豪俊大者谁，本州从事知名久。把臂开尊饮我酒，酒酣击剑蛟龙吼。乌帽拂尘青螺粟，紫衣将炙绯衣走。铜盘烧蜡光吐日，夜如何其初促膝。黄昏始扣主人门，谁谓俄顷胶在漆。万事尽付形骸外，百年未见欢娱毕。神倾意豁真佳士，久客多忧今愈疾。高视乾坤又可愁，一躯交态同悠悠。垂老遇君未恨晚，似君须向古人求。,Reality,Du Fu,Encounter song for Yan Er Farewell,"walk into Dongchuan, look back every ten steps. The city is in chaos, so there is no such thing as Huanhua Thatched Cottage. Who is the hero in Zizhong, who has been well-known in this state for a long time. Open your arms and drink my wine, the wine is full of swords and dragons roar. The black hat whisks the green snail millet, and the purple clothes take the red clothes away. The copper plate burns wax to spit out the sun, how is the night at the beginning of the knee. At dusk, the owner's door is knocked, who said that the glue is in the paint. Everything is gone, and the joy has not been seen in a hundred years. The gods are devoted to the real Jiashi, and the long-term customers are more worried and sicker now. Looking high on the world and worrying about it, the whole body is in the same mood. It is never too late for the elders to meet the king, as if the king must ask the ancients."

The wind and the dust meet each other, and the world and the earth are like a hill. The palace tiles are mandarin ducks, and the palace curtains are emerald. Hook Chen destroys the way, and the spear loses Chu Xu. The cultural relics accompany the patrol, and the relatives and virtuous people are in short supply. When I was in public, I sang it, but I sang it first, but the whale. The situation is comfortable, and Xiao Xiang, the talent is not a fan. Corpses fill Taihang Road, and blood walks in Yiqu.

You should be amazed at the oranges in the lake, and the regular meals account for wild vegetables. Ten years of baby medicine bait, thousands of miles of firewood and fishing. Yangzi flooded into the pavilion, Zou Sheng cherished his train. But Jingfei Yiyao didn't remember changing the toad. Misty rain seals Wu Gorge, Jianghuai slightly Mengzhu.

Arouse scratching one's head anxiously, help walk a few clogs to wear. The two capitals are still thin, and the whole world is absolutely on the shoulders. When the shogunate was handed over at the beginning, Lang Guan was fortunate to prepare staff. Melon time is still traveling in the apartment, and Ping Fan is bitter. The medicine bait is in a mess, and the autumn wind is quiet. Open the placket to drive away miasma, clear eyes to sweep away clouds and smoke. A high banquet for the princes, before the beautiful ladies come to the guests. The mourning zither hurts the boss, and the Huawuyan fairy. The Nannei Kaiyuan song is often passed on by disciples. The sound of Fa's singing changed, and the audience was full of tears. The shadow of Kuizhou is secluded, and the ileum is fried with Duqu. That is to say, in the water of the dragon stables, don't bring dogs and mutton. Geng Jia helped the royal family, and Xiao Cao made an imperial banquet. Take advantage of the power to destroy bees and gnats, and do your best to imitate the eagles. The old things are still there, and the murderer is still evil. The country must go to war, and the people will stop fighting. How does a servant know how to be polite, to be honored and wronged with power. When Hu Xing came back, the head of Guizhou was convulsed. Sad silk fiber cut, harsh laws and regulations. The industry became the first king of Chen, and Zhaoxi came out of the scorpion. The palace ban is dense, and the steps are all worn. Xiong Wei carries Lu Wang, and Hongyan beauty Zhou Xuan. Listen to the master of Zhongxing, and sing a long song without being a wise man. The sound emblem is counted in one column, and there are thousands of prisons in the road. Zheng Liguang's theory of time, the article is ahead of me.

The clouds are blowing and the clouds are here, but the scenery will not be delayed when flooded. At the end of the windy season, the waves will break, and the water monster will not salivate. In the future, she will resign from the goddess and hurt the spring cowardly cuckoo. Indifferent friendships follow gatherings and dispersal, and Zeguo circles around. Originally from Ikasyapa, why did I ever borrow it? The peak of the furnace turns around, and the orange well is still high. Go east and return to the crane poorly, and go south to conquer the kite. I heard many wonderful teachings in the evening, and I practiced the past. Gu Kaidan is listed in green, and Toutuo Wanyan is engraved.

There is growth and solidity spreading, and static and capital dikes. There are many supervisors, and support is quite important. Jingyang has a warm climate, and Susuhou is slightly frosty. I'm still afraid that the master will keep the slack, and I don't pay much attention to it. The Qing Dynasty sent servants and servants to send messages to Chonggang. If everything in the west is gathered, it will be scattered, not alone in our warehouse. Don't want to be kind and honorable, feeling busy in this troubled world.

The scholar in the hall has a blank head, smelling the fragrance three times in the wind and weeping."
现实,杜甫,秋雨叹三首 其二,唐,阑风长雨秋纷纷，四海八荒同一云。去马来牛不复辨，浊泾清渭何当分。禾头生耳黍穗黑，农夫田妇无消息。城中斗米换衾裯，相许宁论两相直。,Reality,Du Fu,Autumn Rain Sighs Three Poems Two,"The wind is long, the rain is long, and the autumn is one after another. The four seas and the eight deserts are the same cloud. Going to Malay cattle is no longer distinguishable, what is the difference between turbid Jing and Qing Wei. The head of the grain grows ears and the ears of millet are black, and there is no news of the farmers and field wives. In the city, a bucket of rice is exchanged for a quilt, and Xu Ning talks about the straightness of the two."
现实,杜甫,秋雨叹三首 其三,唐,长安布衣谁比数，反锁衡门守环堵。老夫不出长蓬蒿，稚子无忧走风雨。雨声飕飕催早寒，胡雁翅湿高飞难。秋来未曾见白日，泥污后土何时乾。,Reality,Du Fu,Autumn Rain sighs three out of three,"Chang'an civilians will count, and the door will be locked and blocked by guards. The old man does not grow basil, and the young child has no worries about the wind and rain. The whistling rain urges the early cold, and the Hu Yan's wings are wet and it is difficult to fly high. Autumn has never seen the day, when will the soil dry after the mud."
现实,杜甫,种莴苣,唐,阴阳一错乱，骄蹇不复理。枯旱于其中，炎方惨如燬。植物半蹉跎，嘉生将已矣。云雷歘奔命，师伯集所使。指麾赤白日，澒洞青光起。雨声先已风，散足尽西靡。山泉落沧江，霹雳犹在耳。终朝纡飒沓，信宿罢潇洒。堂下可以畦，呼童对经始。苣兮蔬之常，随事蓺其子。破块数席间，荷锄功易止。两旬不甲坼，空惜埋泥滓。野苋迷汝来，宗生实于此。此辈岂无秋，亦蒙寒露委。翻然出地速，滋蔓户庭毁。因知邪干正，掩抑至没齿。贤良虽得禄，守道不封己。拥寒败芝兰，众多盛荆杞。中园陷萧艾，老圃永为耻。登于白玉盘，藉以如霞绮。苋也无所施，胡颜入筐篚。,Reality,Du Fu,grow lettuce,"When yin and yang are confused, arrogance and Jian will not answer. Drought in it, Yanfang is miserable. The plants are half wasted, and Jiasheng will be dead. Yun Lei ran for his life, and was entrusted by the masters. Refers to the red and white sun, and the blue light in the cave. The sound of the rain is already the wind, and the feet are scattered to the west. The mountain spring falls into the Cangjiang River, and the thunderbolt is still in my ears. In the end, the dynasty will be rustling, and the letter will be chic. The hall can be bordered, and the children can be called to the scriptures. It's common to eat lettuce and vegetables, and let your son do whatever you want. It's easy to stop the work of hoeing while breaking pieces. There is no armor for two days, and it is a pity to bury the mud. Wild amaranth fans come here, and Zongsheng is here. There is no autumn in this generation, and it is also entrusted by the cold dew. Suddenly, the speed of the ground spread, and the house was destroyed. Knowing that evil does right, he suppresses it until he has no teeth. Although the virtuous are rewarded, they keep the way and do not seal themselves. Embracing the cold and defeating Zhilan, many Shengjing Qi. Zhongyuan fell into Xiaoai, and Laopu was always ashamed. Boarded on a white jade plate, so as to be like Xiaqi. There is nothing to do with amaranth, and Hu Yan goes into the basket."
现实,杜甫,荆南兵马使太常卿赵公大食刀歌,唐,太常楼船声嗷嘈，问兵刮寇趋下牢。牧出令奔飞百艘，猛蛟突兽纷腾逃。白帝寒城驻锦袍，玄冬示我胡国刀。壮士短衣头虎毛，凭轩拔鞘天为高。翻风转日木怒号，冰翼雪澹伤哀猱。镌错碧罂鸊鹈膏，铓锷已瑩虚秋涛。鬼物撇捩辞坑壕，苍水使者扪赤条。龙伯国人罢钓鳌，芮公回首颜色劳。分阃救世用贤豪，赵公玉立高歌起。揽环结佩相终始，万岁持之护天子。得君乱丝与君理，蜀江如线如针水。荆岑弹丸心未已，贼臣恶子休干纪。魑魅魍魉徒为耳，妖腰乱领敢欣喜。用之不高亦不庳，不似长剑须天倚。吁嗟光禄英雄弭，大食宝刀聊可比。丹青宛转麒麟里，光芒六合无泥滓。,Reality,Du Fu,Southern Jingnan Military Envoy Tai Changqing Zhao Gongda Eats the Sword Song,"The sound of boats in the Taichang building is noisy, and the soldiers and bandits tend to go to prison. Mu issued an order to run hundreds of ships, and the fierce dragons and beasts fled one after another. The White Emperor was stationed in brocade robes in the cold city, and Xuandong showed me the Hu Guodao. A strong man wears short clothes with tiger hair on his head, and the sky is as high as he pulls out his sheath from the porch. Turning the wind and turning the sun, the wood howls angrily, and the ice wings and snow are sad and mournful. Engraved with the wrong green poppies and pelican ointment, the scorpion has already Yingxu Qiutao. The ghosts leave the pits and moats, and the messengers of Cangshui touch the naked strips. The people of Uncle Long stopped fishing, Duke Rui turned his head back and looked tired. The virtuous men are used to save the world, Zhao Gongyu stands up and sings. Hold the ring and wear it from beginning to end, long live and protect the emperor. To get the emperor's chaos and the emperor's principles, the Shu River is like a thread like a needle. Jing Cen's heart is full of bullets, and the villain's wicked son is off. Demons and ghosts are only ears, and demon waists and chaotic leaders dare to rejoice. It is neither high nor low, unlike a long sword that needs to be leaned against the sky. Shout out to the heroes of Guanglu, and the big food and treasured sword can be compared. Danqing turns like a unicorn, and the light and world are free of mud."
现实,杜甫,草堂,唐,昔我去草堂，蛮夷塞成都。今我归草堂，成都适无虞。请陈初乱时，反复乃须臾。大将赴朝廷，群小起异图。中宵斩白马，盟歃气已粗。西取邛南兵，北断剑阁隅。布衣数十人，亦拥专城居。其势不两大，始闻蕃汉殊。西卒却倒戈，贼臣互相诛。焉知肘腋祸，自及枭獍徒。义士皆痛愤，纪纲乱相踰。一国实三公，万人欲为鱼。唱和作威福，孰肯辨无辜。眼前列杻械，背后吹笙竽。谈笑行杀戮，溅血满长衢。到今用钺地，风雨闻号呼。鬼妾与鬼马，色悲充尔娱。国家法令在，此又足惊吁。贱子且奔走，三年望东吴。弧矢暗江海，难为游五湖。不忍竟舍此，复来薙榛芜。入门四松在，步屧万竹疏。旧犬喜我归，低徊入衣裾。邻舍喜我归，酤酒携胡芦。大官喜我来，遣骑问所须。城郭喜我来，宾客隘村墟。天下尚未宁，健儿胜腐儒。飘飖风尘际，何地置老夫。于时见疣赘，骨髓幸未枯。饮啄愧残生，食薇不敢馀。,Reality,Du Fu,Cottage,"In the past, when I went to thatched cottage, Chengdu was filled with barbarians. Now that I return to the thatched cottage, Chengdu is safe and sound. When Chen Chu was in chaos, it took a moment to repeat. The general went to the court, and the group had different plans. Cutting the white horse in the middle of the night, the alliance's anger is already strong. Take Qiongnan soldiers in the west, and break the corner of Jiange in the north. There are dozens of civilians, and they also have special city residences. Its power is not two big, and I first heard that Fan and Han are different. The Western soldiers turned against each other, and the thieves and ministers killed each other. How do you know that the disaster of elbows and armpits is as good as owls and owls. The righteous men were all indignant, and Ji Gang was in chaos. One country is actually three lords, and ten thousand people want to be fish. Singing harmony and doing majestic blessings, who is willing to distinguish the innocent. There are instruments in front of the eyes, and the shengyu is played behind the back. Talking and laughing, killing, splashing blood all over the long road. Up to now, the land with ax has been heard, and the wind and rain have been heard. Ghost concubines and ghost horses are full of sorrow and entertainment. The national decree is here, which is enough to alarm. Bitch and run around, looking at Soochow for three years. It is difficult to visit the five lakes when the arc is dark and the river is dark. I couldn't bear to give up this, and came back to Nai Zhenwu. There are four pines at the beginning, and ten thousand bamboos are sparse. The old dog is happy to return, and wanders low into the skirt. Neighbors like me to return, drink wine and gourd. The senior official liked me, and sent a horse to ask what I needed. The city welcomes me, and the guest Ai Village. The world is still in peace, and healthy people are better than rotten Confucians. Floating wind and dust, where to put the old man. At that time, warts were seen, but the bone marrow was fortunately not dry. Drinking pecks are ashamed of the remaining life, but eating Wei dare not leave."

There are also many bandits in the middle of Shu, but the Bai family's achievements are still alive. Sincerely love the royal family and work hard from Yuankun. Three stop Jinjiang boiling, Duqing Yulei faint. The high name enters the bamboo and silk, and the new Wo shines on the universe. The children died first, and the Zhilan piled up. Concentrate on the teacher's law and sprinkle blood on Rongxuan. The silk fiber is actually carried, and the silk crown has been favored. Honor the public to raise the flesh and blood, and punish the traitors. The golden armor is still frozen in snow, but the dust of Zhu Qi does not turn over. Every time I hear about the battlefield, I run away cowardly. There are many thieves in the Holy Lord's country, and virtuous officials are respected. If it is used as a battle axe, it must cut off the roots. Looking back on my sick days, who will talk about the cloud platform. Compose a song for a grand event, and push the hub period for Guqian."
现实,杜甫,贻华阳柳少府,唐,系马乔木间，问人野寺门。柳侯披衣笑，见我颜色温。并坐石下堂，俛视大江奔。火云洗月露，绝壁上朝暾。自非晓相访，触热生病根。南方六七月，出入异中原。老少多暍死，汗踰水浆翻。俊才得之子，筋力不辞烦。指挥当世事，语及戎马存。涕泪溅我裳，悲气排帝阍。郁陶抱长策，义仗知者论。吾衰卧江汉，但愧识玙璠。文章一小技，于道未为尊。起予幸斑白，因是托子孙。俱客古信州，结庐依毁垣。相去四五里，径微山叶繁。时危挹佳士，况免军旅喧。醉从赵女舞，歌鼓秦人盆。子壮顾我伤，我驩兼泪痕。馀生如过鸟，故里今空村。,Reality,Du Fu,Yihuayang Liushao Mansion,"It is between the horses and trees, and asks the gate of Renye Temple. Liu Hou put on his clothes and smiled, seeing that my color is warm. Sitting in the stone hall together, watching the river rush. The fire cloud washes the moon dew, and the cliff faces the sun. Visiting each other from non-awareness, touching the roots of fever and illness. In June and July in the south, go in and out of the Central Plains. Many people, old and young, died, sweating and sweating. The son of a talented man, his muscles and strength are tireless. The command is in the affairs of the world, and the language is about the existence of soldiers and horses. Tears splashed on my clothes, and the sadness dispelled the emperor. Yu Tao has a long-term strategy and is righteous to those who know. I am in decline and lying in Jianghan, but I am ashamed to know Yu Fan. A small skill in the article is not respected in Taoism. I am fortunate to be gray and white, because I am entrusting my descendants. Juke ancient Xinzhou, Jieluyi destroyed the wall. Four or five miles away, there are numerous mountains and leaves in the path. When the time is dangerous, there will be good scholars, but the situation will be free from the noise of the army. Drunk dances from Zhao Nu, sings and drums Qin Renpen. Zizhuang cares about my injury, and I am happy and tear-stained. The rest of my life is like a bird, and my hometown is now an empty village."
现实,杜甫,贻阮隐居,唐,陈留风俗衰，人物世不数。塞上得阮生，迥继先父祖。贫知静者性，自益毛发古。车马入邻家，蓬蒿翳环堵。清诗近道要，识子用心苦。寻我草径微，褰裳蹋寒雨。更议居远村，避喧甘猛虎。足明箕颍客，荣贵如粪土。,Reality,Du Fu,Yi Ruan lived in seclusion,"The customs of Chenliu are declining, and there are countless people in the world. Ruan Sheng, who was on the frontier, followed his father and ancestors. Those who are poor in knowledge and tranquility benefit from the ancient hair. Cars and horses enter the neighbor's house, and Penghao is blocked. Qing poetry is short-cut and important, and it is hard to know children. Look for me, the grass path is small, and the clothes are cold and rainy. It is even more recommended to live in a distant village to avoid noise and tigers. Full Ming Ji Ying guest, honor and honor are like dung."

This morning, my loose eyes suddenly opened, and I burst into tears and whispered things like yesterday. Alas, how generous a strong man is, how famous he is. Sighing that I am desolate and begging for friends, I feel depressed when I am sad. The spring light in Jinli is empty, and Yaochi's courtiers are gone. The water country of Xiaoxiang is close to the eagle owl, and Du Qiu lost the eagle owl. Who cares about the east, west, north and south, the white-headed boat disease survives alone. Yaogong Beichen is entangled with bandits and robbers, and wants to pour the East China Sea to wash the world. The frontier fortresses and Xifan are the most abundant, and there are many people who travel south and south in clothes. Guse still mourns the emperor's son, where to find the king's gate. The article Cao Zhi is turbulent, and he takes Liu Ande's industry respect. Who can worry about the flute, Zhaozhou Cihan and call the soul."
现实,杜甫,送从弟亚赴安西判官,唐,南风作秋声，杀气薄炎炽。盛夏鹰隼击，时危异人至。令弟草中来，苍然请论事。诏书引上殿，奋舌动天意。兵法五十家，尔腹为箧笥。应对如转丸，疏通略文字。经纶皆新语，足以正神器。宗庙尚为灰，君臣俱下泪。崆峒地无轴，青海天轩轾。西极最疮痍，连山暗烽燧。帝曰大布衣，藉卿佐元帅。坐看清流沙，所以子奉使。归当再前席，适远非历试。须存武威郡，为画长久利。孤峰石戴驿，快马金缠辔。黄羊饫不膻，芦酒多还醉。踊跃常人情，惨澹苦士志。安边敌何有，反正计始遂。吾闻驾鼓车，不合用骐骥。龙吟回其头，夹辅待所致。,Reality,Du Fu,Send Congdia to Anxi Judge,"The south wind makes the sound of autumn, and the murderous aura is thin and scorching. In the midsummer, when the falcon strikes, the time is dangerous. Let my brother come to the grass, Cang Ran, please discuss the matter. The imperial edict leads to the palace, and the tongue moves the will of heaven. There are fifty schools of war, and your belly is a box. Response is like turning pills, clearing up the text. All economics are new words, enough to be a magic weapon. The ancestral temple is still ashes, and the monarch and ministers are all in tears. There is no axis in Kongtong, and Tianxuan in Qinghai. The West Pole is the most devastated, and the mountains are dark beacons. The emperor called Dabuyi and borrowed it from Qingzuo Marshal. Sit and see the quicksand, so the son is envoy. Returning to the front seat again, fitness is far from experience. It must be stored in Wuwei County for the long-term profit of the painting. The lonely peak is worn by a stone post, and the fast horse is wrapped with a golden bridle. The yellow goat has no smell, and the reed wine is too much to get drunk. Enthusiastic about ordinary human feelings, desolate and miserable. There is no enemy in Anbian, anyway, the plan is beginning to succeed. I heard that driving a drum chariot is not suitable for a Qi Ji. Long Yin turned his head back, and waited for it."
现实,杜甫,送孔巢父谢病归游江东兼呈李白,唐,巢父掉头不肯住，东将入海随烟雾。诗卷长流天地间，钓竿欲拂珊瑚树。深山大泽龙蛇远，春寒野阴风景暮。蓬莱织女回云车，指点虚无是征路。自是君身有仙骨，世人那得知其故。惜君只欲苦死留，富贵何如草头露。蔡侯静者意有馀，清夜置酒临前除。罢琴惆怅月照席，几岁寄我空中书。南寻禹穴见李白，道甫问信今何如。,Reality,Du Fu,Send Kong Chao's father to thank his illness and return to Jiangdong and present Li Bai,"Chao's father turned around and refused to live, and the east will enter the sea with the smoke. The volume of poems flows between heaven and earth, and the fishing rod wants to brush the coral tree. The mountains are deep, the dragons and snakes are far away, and the wild scenery is twilight in the cold spring. The Weaver Girl of Penglai returns to the cloud car, pointing out that nothingness is the way to go. Since you have immortal bones in your body, the world will know why. Xijun just wants to die in pain, and wealth is like grass. Cai Houjing had a lot of intentions, so he bought wine in the clear night to get rid of it. Strike the piano, melancholy, the moon shines on the mat, and send me a book in the air when I am a few years old. Looking south to Yuxue to see Li Bai, Daofu asked how Xin was doing now."

Huang Bailang in embroidered clothes rides towards Jiaohe Road. Ask Jun Shi Wanli, what grass to take away. The emperor is worried about Liangzhou, and the strict course must arrive early. Go to Qiu Qunhu to rebel, and there will be no electricity. This trip collects the leftovers, and the customs can be recreated. The father of the family led Yuanrong, and he was famous as an old man in the country. Seize my fellow official, float and press the castle. Make me unable to eat, make me hate my arms. If a person thinks broadly, he will be immersed in the island. Poetry is lost in front of the respect, and national treasures are obtained in the plug. The emperor is sad and far away, and the clouds and rain are white and vast. In the eastern suburbs, there are still beacon fires, and the government and the wild are withered. The West Pole is also tilted, how can it be upright."
现实,杜甫,送韦十六评事充同谷郡防禦判官,唐,昔没贼中时，潜与子同游。今归行在所，王事有去留。偪侧兵马间，主忧急良筹。子虽躯干小，老气横九州。挺身艰难际，张目视寇雠。朝廷壮其节，奉诏令参谋。銮舆驻凤翔，同谷为咽喉。西扼弱水道，南镇枹罕陬。此邦承平日，剽劫吏所羞。况乃胡未灭，控带莽悠悠。府中韦使君，道足示怀柔。令侄才俊茂，二美又何求。受词太白脚，走马仇池头。古色沙土裂，积阴雪云稠。羌父豪猪靴，羌儿青兕裘。吹角向月窟，苍山旌旆愁。鸟惊出死树，龙怒拔老湫。古来无人境，今代横戈矛。伤哉文儒士，愤激驰林丘。中原正格斗，后会何缘由。百年赋命定，岂料沈与浮。且复恋良友，握手步道周。论兵远壑净，亦可纵冥搜。题诗得秀句，札翰时相投。,Reality,Du Fu,Send Wei Shiliu to judge affairs as the defense judge of Tonggu County,"In the past, when there were no thieves, Qian and Zi traveled together. Going back to where I am today, the king's affairs have to go or stay. Forced to side soldiers and horses, the Lord is worried and anxious. Although the son has a small body, he is old-fashioned and crosses Kyushu. When it was difficult to stand up, Zhang looked at Kou Yu. The imperial court strengthened its integrity, and was ordered to serve as a staff officer. Luanyu is stationed in Fengxiang, and Tonggu is the throat. The weak waterway is strangled in the west, and the town of Kuanghan is in the south. This country is peaceful, and the plagiarism officials are ashamed. The situation is that Hu is not destroyed, and he is reckless in control. The envoy Wei in the mansion showed his tenderness. Ling nephew is talented, so what can I ask for. The words are too white, and the head of the pool is on the horse. The ancient sand and soil are cracked, and the clouds are thick with cloudy snow. Qiang's father's porcupine boots, Qiang's son's green fur. Blowing the horn to the Moon Cave, Cangshan Jing is sad. The bird startled out of the dead tree, and the dragon angrily pulled out the old man. In ancient times, there was no land, but in this generation, there are spears and spears. It's sad that scholars of literature and Confucianism are angry and galloping Linqiu. The Central Plains is fighting, what will happen later. A hundred years of destiny, unexpectedly sinking and floating. And fall in love with good friends again, shake hands for a week. As far as the soldiers are far away and the ravines are clean, they can also search in the dark. The inscription poems are beautiful sentences, and Zhahan's time is similar."

Wan Fang mourned and provided food for the army for ten years. The official affairs are cut and stripped, and there is no time to worry about the opposite side. There are so many ways to punish and ask, the sage is the virtue. Wei Sheng is rich in spring and autumn, and he has a clear understanding. In charge of Ji Gangdi, I am happy to see Zhu Sizhi. When it is time to seize officials, it has no color since then. If you must save the wounds, you should go to the thieves first. Tears facing the river, Gao Tianyi is sad. Deeds of good governance, comfort me deep memory."

Wowa Qijier, especially Longji. Li Zhou's father and son are named uncles of Qing Junliu. A good boy in the world doesn't have to be fair. Fifteen rich in literature and history, eighteen full of guests. Nineteen school books, twenty brilliant. Every sight in the crowd makes me tremble. Self-afraid of the second son, it is useless to work hard to raise them. In the spring of the first year of Qianyuan, Wan's surname began to settle down. The boat is also dressed in colorful clothes, telling me that I want to be far away. There is hope by leaning on the door, and you can go to service with your back folded. Ascending to Yin Baihua in the south, I have seen Chushanbi. Amiable Xianyang capital, crowned with clouds and clouds. When is Mrs. Tai, relatives will be in the hall. Ruweng grass is bright, and the emperor is sitting in the front seat. How romantic is the return date, don't be grateful in the end. Take care of my penthouse appearance, misunderstand the golden boudoir. Xiao Lai is lazy by nature, and turns to drama in the evening. Every time you feel regretful and stingy, you feel that the world is narrow. Xianjun's teeth are new, and he can be vigilant in the evening. Linqi has a lot of meaning, and he can't eat wine.

Yuan Rong was killed by his subordinates, and there were flying Yan by the lake. The lonely boat is more depressed, and the lonely road is very quiet. Surprised by the ape and Jie Jie, envious of the stork and crane. It is too polite to slaughter fat sheep, and when you are worried, you should put it in the Qing Dynasty. People are not like Shu in the west, but thrive in Beikeng Zhao. Fang Xingchen's bank is quiet, and he doesn't say anything about Changsha's disturbance.

Attracting visitors to watch and get rid of them can be rewarded at any time. At the beginning of the banquet, Cui Hou was already afraid of the sky and worried. I don't know the world's soldiers, so there is no such thing. The grass teeth are green and the buzzing is warm. Thinking of seeing the agricultural equipment Chen, why should he be a soldier? In ancient times, Ge Tianmin did not cause Huangwu to worry. Up to now, Ruan Ji and others have been drunk for their own sake. The majestic phoenix is high, and the long whale swallows Jiuzhou. The earth's axis was turned over, and hundreds of rivers used to flow turbulently. When the song is about to be released, I'm afraid there will be no tears. There is a good reason for the turbid mash, and the common people use it to comfort the ups and downs."
现实,杜甫,望岳,唐,岱宗夫如何，齐鲁青未了。造化钟神秀，阴阳割昏晓。荡胸生曾云，决眦入归鸟。会当凌绝顶，一览众山小。,Reality,Du Fu,Wangyue,"How about Mrs. Dai Zong, Qi Lu is still young. The good fortune clock is beautiful, and the yin and yang are at dawn. Zeng Yun was born by swinging the chest, and the returning bird entered the canthus. It will be the top of the mountain, and you can see all the small mountains."
现实,杜甫,望岳,唐,南岳配朱鸟，秩礼自百王。歘吸领地灵，鸿洞半炎方。邦家用祀典，在德非馨香。巡守何寂寥，有虞今则亡。洎吾隘世网，行迈越潇湘。渴日绝壁出，漾舟清光旁。祝融五峰尊，峰峰次低昴。紫盖独不朝，争长嶪相望。恭闻魏夫人，群仙夹翱翔。有时五峰气，散风如飞霜。牵迫限修途，未暇杖崇冈。归来觊命驾，沐浴休玉堂。三叹问府主，曷以赞我皇。牲璧忍衰俗，神其思降祥。,Reality,Du Fu,Wangyue,"Nanyue is paired with red birds, and the order is from a hundred kings. Sucking the spirit of the land, the hole is half-flame. The national family sacrificial ceremonies are fragrant in Defei. How lonely it is to patrol, if there is danger today, it will die. Jiewu pass the world network, and travel more and more Xiaoxiang. The thirsty sun emerges from the cliff, and the boat is next to the clear light. Zhurong Wufeng Zun, Fengfeng is inferior to Pleiades. Zi Gai does not go to court alone, but fights for the elders to look at each other. After hearing Mrs. Wei respectfully, the immortals are soaring. Sometimes the air of five peaks is scattered like flying frost. Forced to limit the repair of the road, I have no time to stick to Chonggang. Come back and wait for your life, take a bath in Xiuyutang. Ask the palace lord with three sighs, and praise my emperor. The biscuit endures the decline of vulgarity, and the gods think of it to bring auspiciousness."
现实,杜甫,望岳,唐,西岳崚嶒竦处尊，诸峰罗立如儿孙。安得仙人九节杖，拄到玉女洗头盆。车箱入谷无归路，箭栝通天有一门。稍待西风凉冷后，高寻白帝问真源。,Reality,Du Fu,Wangyue,"Xiyue Ling is respected at all places, and all the peaks stand like children and grandchildren. Immortal Ande's nine-jointed staff is on the jade girl's shampoo basin. There is no way back when the carriage enters the valley, and there is a door for the arrow to reach the sky. After waiting for the west wind to cool down, Emperor Gao Xun asked the true source."
现实,杜甫,梦李白二首 其一,唐,死别已吞声，生别常恻恻。江南瘴疠地，逐客无消息。故人入我梦，明我长相忆。恐非平生魂，路远不可测。魂来枫叶青，魂返关塞黑。君今在罗网，何以有羽翼。落月满屋梁，犹疑照颜色。水深波浪阔，无使蛟龙得。,Reality,Du Fu,"Dream of Li Bai, one of two poems","Farewell to death has been swallowed, life is often sad. In the pestilent land in the south of the Yangtze River, there is no news of chasing guests. The old man enters my dream, making me remember each other. I'm afraid it's not a lifelong soul, and the road is far and unpredictable. The soul comes to Maple Leaf Green, and the soul returns to Guansai Hei. You are in the net now, why do you have wings? The falling moon is all over the beams of the house, hesitating to illuminate the color. The water is deep and the waves are wide, and there is no way for the dragon to get it."
现实,杜甫,梦李白二首 其二,唐,浮云终日行，游子久不至。三夜频梦君，情亲见君意。告归常局促，苦道来不易。江湖多风波，舟楫恐失坠。出门搔白首，若负平生志。冠盖满京华，斯人独憔悴。孰云网恢恢，将老身反累。千秋万岁名，寂莫身后事。,Reality,Du Fu,Dream Li Bai Two Poems,"Floating clouds travel all day long, but wanderers never arrive. Three nights of frequent dreams of the king, and the love of the king sees the king's will. It is often cramped to report back, and the bitter road is not easy. There are many turmoil in the rivers and lakes, and the boats are afraid of falling. Scratching the white head when you go out is like losing your life ambitions. The crown is full of Jinghua, and the Sri Lankan is alone and haggard. When the cloud and network are restored, the old body will be tired. Qianqiu long live name, lonely nothing behind."
现实,杜甫,清明,唐,著处繁花务是日，长沙千人万人出。渡头翠柳艳明眉，争道朱蹄骄齧膝。此都好游湘西寺，诸将亦自军中至。马援征行在眼前，葛强亲近同心事。金镫下山红粉晚，牙樯捩柁青楼远。古时丧乱皆可知，人世悲欢暂相遣。弟侄虽存不得书，干戈未息苦离居。逢迎少壮非吾道，况乃今朝更祓除。,Reality,Du Fu,Ching Ming,"It's the day when there are flowers everywhere, and thousands of people come out of Changsha. The green willows at the crossing head have bright eyebrows, and the red hooves are arrogant and gnaw their knees. This is a good place to visit Xiangxi Temple, and the generals also came from the army. Ma Yuanzheng is walking in front of him, and Ge Qiang is close to the same thing. The golden stirrup goes down the mountain and the pink powder is late, and the tooth mast is far away from the brothel. In ancient times, we can all know the mourning and chaos, and the joys and sorrows of the world are temporarily sent away. Although the younger brother and nephew can't keep the books, the fighting has not stopped and they are away from home. It is not my way to cater to the young and strong, and the situation is even more exorcising today."
现实,杜甫,渔阳,唐,渔阳突骑犹精锐，赫赫雍王都节制。猛将飘然恐后时，本朝不入非高计。禄山北筑雄武城，旧防败走归其营。系书请问燕耆旧，今日何须十万兵。,Reality,Du Fu,Yuyang,"Yuyang's sudden cavalry is still elite, and King Heheyong controls it. When the fierce generals are terrified, this court is not planning. Lushan built Xiongwu City in the north, and the old defenses were defeated and returned to their camp. In the book, I would like to ask Yan Qijiu why he needs 100,000 soldiers today."
现实,杜甫,营屋,唐,我有阴江竹，能令朱夏寒。阴通积水内，高入浮云端。甚疑鬼物凭，不顾剪伐残。东偏若面势，户牖永可安。爱惜已六载，兹晨去千竿。萧萧见白日，汹汹开奔湍。度堂匪华丽，养拙异考槃。草茅虽薙葺，衰疾方少宽。洗然顺所适，此足代加餐。寂无斤斧响，庶遂憩息欢。,Reality,Du Fu,camp,"I have Yinjiang bamboo, which can make Zhu Xia cold. Yintong stagnant water, high into the floating clouds. Very suspicious of ghosts and things, regardless of cutting and cutting. If you face the situation in the east, Huyu can be safe forever. It has been six years of cherishing, and I will go to Qiangan in the morning. When Xiao Xiao saw the daylight, the turmoil drove forward. The hall is gorgeous, but the humble is different from the test. Although the thatch is pruned, it is less wide when it is old and sick. Wash and follow suit, this foot replaces meal. There is no sound of catty and axe, so the common people rest and enjoy themselves."
现实,杜甫,谒文公上方,唐,野寺隐乔木，山僧高下居。石门日色异，绛气横扶疏。窈窕入风磴，长芦纷卷舒。庭前猛虎卧，遂得文公庐。俯视万家邑，烟尘对阶除。吾师雨花外，不下十年馀。长者自布金，禅龛只晏如。大珠脱玷翳，白月当空虚。甫也南北人，芜蔓少耘锄。久遭诗酒污，何事忝簪裾。王侯与蝼蚁，同尽随丘墟。愿闻第一义，回向心地初。金篦刮眼膜，价重百车渠。无生有汲引，兹理傥吹嘘。,Reality,Du Fu,Yewen Gongshang,"There are hidden trees in the wild temple, and mountain monks live high and low. The color of Shimen is different from day to day, and the crimson energy is horizontal and sparse. Slender and graceful into the wind, the long reeds are rolled and stretched. The tiger lay down in front of the court, so Wengong Lu was obtained. Looking down at Wanjiayi, the smoke and dust are eliminated on the steps. My teacher Yuhuawai, no less than ten years. The elders clothe themselves with gold, and the Zen niche is only Yanru. The big pearl is defiled, and the white moon is empty. Fu is also from the north and the south, and the vines are less hoeed. I have been polluted by poetry and wine for a long time, what's the matter with the hairpin and train? Princes and ants all follow Qiuxu together. I wish to hear the first righteousness and return to the beginning of my heart. The gold grate scraping eye mask is worth a hundred cars. There is no life to draw, hereby boast."
现实,杜甫,野望因过常少仙,唐,野桥齐度马，秋望转悠哉。竹覆青城合，江从灌口来。入村樵径引，尝果栗皱开。落尽高天日，幽人未遣回。,Reality,Du Fu,Ambition is too much,"The wild bridges are all riding horses, and the autumn look is leisurely. Bamboo covers Qingchenghe, and the river comes from Guankou. Enter the village woodcutter path, taste the chestnuts and wrinkle them. The sun has fallen to the top of the sky, but Youren has not been sent back."
现实,杜甫,铜瓶,唐,乱后碧井废，时清瑶殿深。铜瓶未失水，百丈有哀音。侧想美人意，应非寒甃沈。蛟龙半缺落，犹得折黄金。,Reality,Du Fu,copper bottle,"After the chaos, the blue well was abandoned, and the palace of Qingyao was deep at that time. The copper bottle did not lose water, and there was a mournful sound at a hundred feet. If you think about beauty, it should be cold and heavy. The dragon is half missing, and it is still worth gold."
现实,杜甫,阌乡姜七少府设脍戏赠长歌,唐,姜侯设脍当严冬，昨日今日皆天风。河冻未渔不易得，凿冰恐侵河伯宫。饔人受鱼鲛人手，洗鱼磨刀鱼眼红。无声细下飞碎雪，有骨已剁觜春葱。偏劝腹腴愧年少，软炊香饭缘老翁。落砧何曾白纸湿，放箸未觉金盘空。新欢便饱姜侯德，清觞异味情屡极。东归贪路自觉难，欲别上马身无力。可怜为人好心事，于我见子真颜色。不恨我衰子贵时，怅望且为今相忆。,Reality,Du Fu,Jiang Qishao Mansion in Yan Township set up a popular opera to present long songs,"Jiang Hou set it up as a severe winter, yesterday and today are all windy. The frozen river is not easy to get without fishing, and ice digging may invade the Hebo Palace. People who eat fish are handed by fish and sharks, and fish are jealous when they wash fish and sharpen knives. Snow falls silently and finely, and spring onions with bones have been chopped. I would like to persuade you to be ashamed of being young, but to be an old man with soft cooking and fragrant rice. When the anvil fell, the white paper was never wet, and the golden plate was empty when I put the chopsticks on. Xinhuan will be full of Jiang Houde, and the taste of the clear cup will be extremely intense. The road back to the east is difficult, and I am powerless to get on the horse. Poor and kind-hearted, I see his true colors. I don't hate when my son is expensive, but I look forward to it and remember it for the present."
现实,杜甫,鹿头山,唐,鹿头何亭亭，是日慰饥渴。连山西南断，俯见千里豁。游子出京华，剑门不可越。及兹险阻尽，始喜原野阔。殊方昔三分，霸气曾间发。天下今一家，云端失双阙。悠然想扬马，继起名硉兀。有文令人伤，何处埋尔骨。纡馀脂膏地，惨澹豪侠窟。仗钺非老臣，宣风岂专达。冀公柱石姿，论道邦国活。斯人亦何幸，公镇逾岁月。,Reality,Du Fu,Lutou Mountain,"The deer head He Tingting is a day to comfort the hunger and thirst. Lianshan is cut off in the southwest, and you can see thousands of miles away. When a wanderer leaves Jinghua, the sword gate cannot be crossed. And hereby the dangers are all over, and I am happy that the wilderness is wide. In the past, the special party was three points, and the domineering spirit was once in a while. The world is one family, and the clouds lose their double ques. Leisurely wanted to raise a horse, so he named it Wuwu. There are texts that hurt people, but where are the bones buried. The remaining fat and creamy land is bleak and heroic cave. If you are not an old minister with a battle axe, how can the Xuanfeng be specially developed. Ji Gong's pillars and stone postures discuss the life of the country. Fortunately for the people of Sri Lanka, the public town is over the years."
现实,杜甫,黄草,唐,黄草峡西船不归，赤甲山下行人稀。秦中驿使无消息，蜀道兵戈有是非。万里秋风吹锦水，谁家别泪湿罗衣。莫愁剑阁终堪据，闻道松州已被围。,Reality,Du Fu,yellow grass,"The boats from the west of Huangcao Gorge do not return, and there are few pedestrians at the foot of Chijia Mountain. There is no news from Qin Zhongyi's emissary, and there are right and wrong in the war of Shu Dao. Thousands of miles of autumn wind blows Jinshui, so don't weep Luoyi with tears. Mochou's sword pavilion is finally ready, and it is heard that Songzhou has been besieged."
现实,杜甫,喜雨,唐,春旱天地昏，日色赤如血。农事都已休，兵戈况骚屑。巴人困军须，恸哭厚土热。沧江夜来雨，真宰罪一雪。谷根小苏息，沴气终不灭。何由见宁岁，解我忧思结。峥嵘群山云，交会未断绝。安得鞭雷公，滂沱洗吴越。,Reality,Du Fu,happy rain,"In the spring drought, the sky and the earth are dark, and the sun is as red as blood. The farming work has been suspended, and the situation of the war is disgraceful. The Ba people were besieged by the army, weeping and crying. When the Cangjiang River rains at night, it really kills the snow. The root of the valley takes a rest, and the breath will never die. Why see Ning Sui, solve my worries and thoughts. The majestic mountains and clouds, the rendezvous has not been cut off. An De whipped Lei Gong and washed Wu Yue in a torrent."
现实,杜甫,喜晴,唐,皇天久不雨，既雨晴亦佳。出郭眺西郊，肃肃春增华。青荧陵陂麦，窈窕桃李花。春夏各有实，我饥岂无涯。干戈虽横放，惨澹斗龙蛇。甘泽不犹愈，且耕今未赊。丈夫则带甲，妇女终在家。力难及黍稷，得种菜与麻。千载商山芝，往者东门瓜。其人骨已朽，此道谁疵瑕。英贤遇轗轲，远引蟠泥沙。顾惭昧所适，回首白日斜。汉阴有鹿门，沧海有灵查。焉能学众口，咄咄空咨嗟。,Reality,Du Fu,Hi Haru,"It doesn't rain for a long time in the emperor's sky, and it is rainy and sunny. Going out of the country to look at the western suburbs, susu spring is flourishing. Qingyingling Pimai, slim peaches and plums. Spring and summer have their own reality, and my hunger has no limit. Although fighting horizontally, it is miserable to fight dragons and snakes. Ganze is not still healed, and there is no credit for plowing today. The husband wears armor, and the woman stays at home. It is hard to match millet, but vegetables and hemp can be grown. For thousands of years, Shangshanzhi, and Dongmengua in the past. His human bones are rotten, so no one is flawed in this way. When Yingxian meets Yu Ke, he draws the mud and sand from afar. Gu is ashamed of what is suitable, looking back at the daylight. There is Lumen in Hanyin, and Lingcha in the sea. How can you learn from everyone, and be aggressive and empty."
现实,杜甫,寒硖,唐,行迈日悄悄，山谷势多端。云门转绝岸，积阻霾天寒。寒硖不可度，我实衣裳单。况当仲冬交，溯沿增波澜。野人寻烟语，行子傍水餐。此生免荷殳，未敢辞路难。,Reality,Du Fu,Cold Kip,"The day of walking is quiet, and the valley is full of potential. The cloud gate turns to the shore, and the accumulation of haze and cold weather. It's too cold, and I have only a single dress. The situation is at the turn of midwinter, and there are more waves along the way. The savage looks for smoke and words, and the traveler eats by the water. This life is free from the lotus, and I dare not say goodbye to the difficult road."
现实,杜甫,彭衙行,唐,忆昔避贼初，北走经险艰。夜深彭衙道，月照白水山。尽室久徒步，逢人多厚颜。参差谷鸟吟，不见游子还。痴女饥咬我，啼畏虎狼闻。怀中掩其口，反侧声愈嗔。小儿强解事，故索苦李餐。一旬半雷雨，泥泞相牵攀。既无禦雨备，径滑衣又寒。有时经契阔，竟日数里间。野果充糇粮，卑枝成屋椽。早行石上水，暮宿天边烟。少留周家洼，欲出芦子关。故人有孙宰，高义薄曾云。延客已曛黑，张灯启重门。煖汤濯我足，剪纸招我魂。从此出妻孥，相视涕阑干。众雏烂熳睡，唤起沾盘餐。誓将与夫子，永结为弟昆。遂空所坐堂，安居奉我欢。谁肯艰难际，豁达露心肝。别来岁月周，胡羯仍搆患。何当有翅翎，飞去堕尔前。,Reality,Du Fu,Peng Yahang,"Recalling the early days of avoiding thieves, traveling north through dangers and hardships. Late at night on Peng Ya Road, the moon shines on Baishui Mountain. Do room for a long time on foot, every person is so cheeky. The birds sing in different valleys, but the wanderer does not return. The idiot bites me hungry, and crows in fear of tigers and wolves. Covering his mouth in his arms, the sideways voice became more angry. The child forced to explain the matter, so he asked for Li Fan. Ten and a half thunderstorms, muddy each other. There is no rain protection, and the clothes are slippery and cold. Sometimes it takes a few miles to pass through the Qikuo. The wild fruit is full of food, and the humble branches form the rafters of the house. Walk on the rocks and water in the morning, and stay in the sky in the evening. Stay in Zhoujiawa less, and want to leave Luziguan. Old people include Sun Zai, Gao Yi and Bo Zengyun. Yanke is already dark, and the door is opened with lights. The warm soup washes my feet, and the paper-cut draws my soul. Since then, wives and children have been born, and they look at each other with tears. All the chicks rotted and fell asleep, awakening the plate meal. I swear that I will be my younger brother forever with my master. Suikong sat in the hall and lived in peace and made me happy. Who is willing to face hardships, open-minded and open-minded. Don't come for years and weeks, Hu Jie is still in trouble. Why should you have wings and feathers, fly to fall in front of you."

There was no sound of battle in the open sky, and 40,000 rebels died on the same day. The group of Hus returned and washed their arrows with blood, and they still sang Hu songs to drink the city.

The sage crowns the history books, and the branch sends Luo Yuanjin. Today, you are upright and upright, no one dares to kiss you if you are clever or fake. Jieli is my brother, and he is willing to kill himself when he is in need. Things are taboo and defiled, and deeds are pure and true. Offend Yongtaimo and release him to Wuxibin. There is Luan and Phoenix, and Zeng Baolin, a former Confucian. The thunderbolt grows the pine, but the bones are big but the tendons are born. One loss is not enough to hurt, and Nianzi cherishes himself. Mooring the boat to the shore of Chu Palace, love Que Hao sour. Removed from the name to match the Qingjiang River, adjacent to Juetu Wu Gorge. Landing will be the first journey, and the pen is in vain. Returning to the imperial bureau, the lungs are sick, reminiscing about the past and thinking about it. The spring breeze is strong and the waves are strong, and the valley turns quite a bit. I can pan the middle class, offend the moron and hate. I have been saving for many years, and comfort this Zhenliang minister."

The rich drive the big boats with money, and the poor take them to the boats. Children stop learning the Analects of Confucius, and older children stop traveling with business. Turn the sail sideways and enter the waves, and there is no danger in the whirlpool. In the morning, when the white emperor was in the evening, Jiangling, it was lucky to witness the levy after a while. Qutang is full of tiger beards and anger, and the governor of Guizhou is the best at traveling for many years. The popularity of this township is narrow, and it is mistaken to compete with the south wind and sparse the north. If there are no handsome talents in Taoism, He Deshan has Qu Yuan's house."

Unbearable to replace white feathers, enough to eliminate flies. Yingying gold wrong knife, Zhu Si fly. Not only is the color good, it is also called Gu Pan. I always suffer from illness, and my family is poor and suffering from fever. Smack the skin and burn out the tiredness, Lai Ergan remembers it. Things are abandoned in the small world, who is willing to conquer righteousness. At the age of three, Qingqiu came, and I didn't dare to pass the vine."

The world is miserable and suddenly different, and the waves are endless hectares of colored glaze. Liuli Khan goes boating, and things are very exciting and worrying. I don't know how to swallow a whale, how can the evil wind and white waves catch me. The master, Jin Fan, is in love with each other, and Zhouzi is very happy. The ducklings are scattered and their hair is scattered, and the silk pipes are chirping in the air. The sinking pole continues to grow unfathomably, and the water chestnut leaf lotus is as quiet as a wipe. Wan is in the middle of the river, Bo Liqing, and down to the endless and southern black. Banbei has been immersed in the mountains in the south, and the moving shadows are graceful and harmonious. The side of the boat is dark at Yunji Temple, and the moon rises from Lantian Pass on the water surface. At this time, Lilong also spits out pearls, and Feng Yi beats the drums and the dragons chase. The concubines of Xiang and the Han girls sing and dance, and the golden branch and emerald flag are all there. It's so close, but I'm worried about the thunderstorm, and I don't know the spirit of the gods. How old was he when he was young, there have always been so many sorrows and joys."

The reeds leave and go, and the sky and water will be together forever. With a new eye, it seems like a strike, and the heart has already been grasped. It's like a person who recognizes sharks, but a fisherman who recognizes fish boats in the air. Grinding Nancui by mistake, turning the shadow of Baige upside down. Add brilliance to the mountains, cherish the hectares in the mausoleum. Lao Sheng is ashamed of Yan Zheng, and foreign things admire Zhang Bing. The world is rejuvenated by Hua Liu, and I am willing to mix frogs and striders. Knowing to return to the vulgar is negligible, and taking what is appropriate is not the same.

The boat and the car are half a day, and the host and the guest are more entertaining. The white blade is unrighteous, and the gold is poured out. In the world of murderers, the reward lies in Sixu. Recalling Gao Li's generation, talking about handing in wine. The two males are strong and thinking, so I am full of color.

The first emperor happened to be martial, and the world and the sea did not wither. The fierce generals will take over the Western Regions, and the long halberds will break the Linhu. Attack a city with a million, and you won't lose if you win. Group training is discarded like mud, and a foot of soil is negative for a hundred people. The work of expanding the realm has not yet been completed, and Yuanhe Ci is a big furnace. The friends who are separated from each other are exhausted, and the years are together. How can I be entrusted with my decline, and I will cry again after I survive. I am ashamed of being depressed, and I am alone in a corner of the sky.

Calling for public and private diseases, tax collection does not make up for the shortage. So the old man cried on his back, to whom the wounds would be counted. Violence or previous news, whipping witches is not ancient. Please stop the armored soldiers first, and listen to the owner for punishment. There are all kinds of industries in all nations, and they can't take everything. There are countless floods and droughts, and Yao Tang avoids witnessing them. The sky melts gold and stones, and bandits and jackals make chaos. The two keep one end, and the transgression will not heal. Last night Yin Qilei, the wind passed Qi Wannu. When the haze is blown again, the haze is scattered, and the gods are gathered together in a false sense. The breath melts in the intestines and stomach, and the clothes are stained with sweat.

Looking up greedily to see the bird, turning back the wrong person. It is difficult to read, and the pot is full of wine. Knowing Emei old closely, I know that it is true that I am lazy."

The sky is high and the clouds are gone, and the moon in the river is late. Fading and thanking help the sick more often, inviting invitations frequently. The other party takes advantage of this excitement, and the joy is not without sadness. Cutting bamboo is the same as the structure of the bridge, and clothes are not involved in traffic. The white crane returns to Huabiao in the cold sky, and the green dragon sees the water at sunset. Gu I am not a questioner, knowing the king is the work of Jichuan. Hehuan laughs at the millennium matter, when will the driving stone arrive in Haidong."
现实,杜甫,观李固请司马弟山水图三首,唐,简易高人意，匡床竹火炉。寒天留远客，碧海挂新图。虽对连山好，贪看绝岛孤。群仙不愁思，冉冉下蓬壶。方丈浑连水，天台总映云。人间长见画，老去恨空闻。范蠡舟偏小，王乔鹤不群。此生随万物，何路出尘氛。高浪垂翻屋，崩崖欲压床。野桥分子细，沙岸绕微茫。红浸珊瑚短，青悬薜荔长。浮查并坐得，仙老暂相将。,Reality,Du Fu,Viewing Li Gu's Invitation to Sima Di's Three Landscapes,"Simple and satisfactory, Kuang bed bamboo stove. The cold weather stays far away, and the blue sea hangs new pictures. Although he is good to Lianshan, he is greedy to see the lonely island. The immortals don't worry about thinking, and they slowly descend the pot. The abbot is muddy and connected to the water, and the roof always reflects the clouds. The world sees paintings for a long time, but hates nothingness when it grows old. Fan Lizhou was rather small, and Wang Qiaohe was out of the crowd. This life follows all things, how can we get out of the dusty atmosphere. The high waves overturn the house, and the cliff collapses to crush the bed. The molecules of the wild bridge are thin, and the sandy shore is boundless. The red-soaked coral is short, and the green-hanging sapling is long. Floating checks and sitting together, the immortals will temporarily meet."
现实,杜甫,江头五咏 其二 栀子,唐,栀子比众木，人间诚未多。于身色有用，与道气伤和。红取风霜实，青看雨露柯。无情移得汝，贵在映江波。故使笼宽织，须知动损毛。看云莫怅望，失水任呼号。六翮曾经剪，孤飞卒未高。且无鹰隼虑，留滞莫辞劳。花鸭无泥滓，阶前每缓行。羽毛知独立，黑白太分明。不觉群心妒，休牵众眼惊。稻粱沾汝在，作意莫先鸣。,Reality,Du Fu,Jiangtou Wuyong Qi Er Gardenia,"Gardenia is more than all trees, and there are not many sincerities in the world. Useful for body color, harmonize with Dao Qi. Red takes wind and frost, green looks at rain and dew. If you are ruthlessly moved, the most important thing is to reflect Jiangbo. Therefore, make the cage wide and weave, and you must know that the hair will be damaged by movement. Don't be disappointed when you look at the clouds, let's call if you lose water. Liuhe was once cut, but the lonely flying soldier was not high. And no falcons to worry about, stay behind and don't quit your work. The flower duck has no mud, and walks slowly before the steps. Feather knows independence, black and white are too distinct. Don't feel the jealousy of the crowd, don't be shocked by the eyes of the crowd. When the rice grains stick to you, don't make any noise first."

Thin leaves with floating hairs, sparse flower cape plain. After planting Xiaozhai deeply, the common people occupy it near Youren. Falling into the orchid musk deer at night, don't be pregnant with powder. Baicao competes with Chunhua, and Lichun should win the most. Less beard, better color, more branches left. There are peaches and plums, and they can always move everywhere. How expensive it is, but I'm afraid someone will know."

The Chengjiang River is flat and the shore is short, and the secluded trees are full of flowers at night. The fish come out in the drizzle, and the swallows slant in the breeze. There are 100,000 households in the city, and there are two or three here. Shutian often rains at night, and the river threshold is already sunny. Ye Runlin's pond is dense, and the clothes are dry and the pillow is clear. Unbearable old age and sickness, how can I get a false name. Shallow to trickle wine, deep to send this life."

No body but young and strong, traces but restraint. The river flows through the city walls, and the spring breeze blows into the drums. Both new swallows still have mud in their mouths. Climb to the eye of the building by the sky, and enter the hometown with spring. The battlefield is set now, and it is better to move willows. I hate the coldness of making friends in Shu, and think about Wu Sheng's affairs. You should arrange the boats and go down to Jingmen with a long roar."

The green eyebrows are lingering, and the clouds are like branches. Immediately, the mountains and mountains are at dusk, and the boat is fragrant with water. Let the king have his own wife, don't learn from wild mandarin ducks."

A century of double white temples, a farewell to five autumn fireflies. Endure the contents of the cup and read the motto. You can't cover it with soap and chase duckweed when you're drunk. When the staff can be used, it can come out, and the king's family travels differently. It is known that I can't afford to sigh, but I am not allowed to stay drunk. Shu wine is thick and invincible, and river fish is beautiful. Finally thinking about being drunk, sweeping the head of Yanchi. There is no way back for a group of thieves, and the bad face will go far away. Shang Lianshi's warning policy, I still remember the drunken madness. Lu Weimi respected, Xu Chenlue died. If the old man is free, he should be read early and rise to the hall."
现实,杜甫,有感五首,唐,将帅蒙恩泽，兵戈有岁年。至今劳圣主，何以报皇天。白骨新交战，云台旧拓边。乘槎断消息，无处觅张骞。幽蓟馀蛇豕，乾坤尚虎狼。诸侯春不贡，使者日相望。慎勿吞青海，无劳问越裳。大君先息战，归马华山阳。洛下舟车入，天中贡赋均。日闻红粟腐，寒待翠华春。莫取金汤固，长令宇宙新。不过行俭德，盗贼本王臣。丹桂风霜急，青梧日夜凋。由来强干地，未有不臣朝。受钺亲贤往，卑宫制诏遥。终依古封建，岂独听箫韶。盗灭人还乱，兵残将自疑。登坛名绝假，报主尔何迟。领郡辄无色，之官皆有词。愿闻哀痛诏，端拱问疮痍。,Reality,Du Fu,Feeling five,"General Meng Enze has been fighting for years. So far, I have worked hard for the Holy Lord, how can I repay the emperor. The bones of the dead fight new battles, and the old Yuntai expands its borders. Taking the opportunity to break the news, there is nowhere to find Zhang Qian. There are still snakes and hogs in the secluded Ji, and the universe is still tigers and wolves. The princes pay no tribute in spring, and the envoys look at each other every day. Be careful not to swallow Qinghai, and ask Yue Chang without trouble. The Maharaja stopped the war first and returned to Mahua Shanyang. Luo got off the boat and drove in, and all the tributes were paid in the sky. I hear the red millet rot every day, and wait for Cuihua spring in the cold. Don't take gold and soup solid, long-term make the universe new. But frugality, thieves are the king's ministers. Osmanthus osmanthus is in a hurry, and Qingwu withers day and night. The origin is strong and dry, and there is no disobedience. Received the Yueqian relatives to go, the humble palace made the imperial edict away. In the end, according to the ancient feudalism, don't you only listen to Xiao Shao. Stealing and destroying people will cause chaos, and the disabled will doubt themselves. The name on the altar is absolutely fake, how late is it to report to the master. The leader of the county is colorless, and all the officials have words. I would like to hear the mourning edict, and Duan Gong asked about the wounds."
现实,杜甫,西山三首,唐,彝界荒山顶，蕃州积雪边。筑城依白帝，转粟上青天。蜀将分旗鼓，羌兵助井泉。西戎背和好，杀气日相缠。辛苦三城戍，长防万里秋。烟尘侵火井，雨雪闭松州。风动将军幕，天寒使者裘。漫山贼营垒，回首得无忧。子弟犹深入，关城未解围。蚕崖铁马瘦，灌口米船稀。辩士安边策，元戎决胜威。今朝乌鹊喜，欲报凯歌归。,Reality,Du Fu,Three Songs of Xishan,"The top of the barren mountain in the Yi world, the snow-covered edge of Fanzhou. Build the city according to Baidi, turn millet to the blue sky. The generals of Shu will divide the banners and drums, and the Qiang soldiers will help Jingquan. Xirong reconciles with each other, and the murderous entanglement is entangled day by day. Work hard to defend the three cities, long-term defense Wanliqiu. Smoke and dust invaded the fire well, and rain and snow closed Songzhou. The wind moves the general's curtain, and the weather makes Qiu the envoy. Man bandit camp, look back without any worries. The children are still deep, and the siege of Guancheng has not been relieved. Silkworm cliffs and iron horses are thin, and rice boats are thin. The debater secures the border strategy, and the Yuan Rong decides to win the prestige. At present, the black magpie is happy and wants to return with a triumphant song."
现实,杜甫,陪王使君晦日泛江就黄家亭子二首,唐,山豁何时断，江平不肯流。稍知花改岸，始验鸟随舟。结束多红粉，欢娱恨白头。非君爱人客，晦日更添愁。有径金沙软，无人碧草芳。野畦连蛱蝶，江槛俯鸳鸯。日晚烟花乱，风生锦绣香。不须吹急管，衰老易悲伤。,Reality,Du Fu,Accompanying Wang Shijun on a dark day and going across the river to Huangjia Pavilion two poems,"When the mountain breaks, Jiangping refuses to flow. Knowing that the flowers have changed shores, I began to test the birds with the boat. End the red powder, rejoice and hate whiteheads. If you don't love guests, you will worry even more on dark days. There is a path where the sand is soft, and there is no one with green grass. Nymphs and butterflies on wild borders, mandarin ducks on river thresholds. The fireworks are chaotic day and night, and the wind produces a splendid fragrance. There is no need to blow the emergency pipe, aging is easy to be sad."
现实,杜甫,自阆州领妻子却赴蜀州山行三首,唐,汨汨避群盗，悠悠经十年。不成向南国，复作游西川。物役水虚照，魂伤山寂然。我生无倚著，尽室畏途边。长林偃风色，回复意犹迷。衫裛翠微润，马衔青草嘶。栈悬斜避石，桥断却寻溪。何日干戈尽，飘飘愧老妻。行色递隐见，人烟时有无。仆夫穿竹语，稚子入云呼。转石惊魑魅，抨弓落狖鼯。真供一笑乐，似欲慰穷途。,Reality,Du Fu,"I took my wife from Langzhou, but went to Shuzhou for three trips in the mountains","Mi Mi avoided bandits for ten years. If you can't go to the southern country, you can travel to Xichuan again. The water is empty, and the soul is hurt and the mountain is silent. I was born with nothing to lean on, and I was afraid of the side of the road. Changlin Yan's demeanor is still lost in his reply. The shirt is green and slightly moist, and the horse's title is green grass. The stack is suspended to avoid stones, but the bridge is broken to find the stream. When the battle is over, I will feel ashamed of my old wife. The color of the line is invisible, and there are no people. The servant speaks through bamboo, and the child speaks into the clouds. Turn the stone to surprise the charm, and criticize the bow to drop the glider. It's really a smile, it seems to comfort the poor."
现实,杜甫,过故斛斯校书庄二首,唐,此老已云殁，邻人嗟亦休。竟无宣室召，徒有茂陵求。妻子寄他食，园林非昔游。空馀穗帷在，淅淅野风秋。燕入非旁舍，鸥归祗故池。断桥无复板，卧柳自生枝。遂有山阳作，多惭鲍叔知。素交零落尽，白首泪双垂。,Reality,Du Fu,Two Poems of Guogusi Xiaoshuzhuang,"This old man has passed away, and the neighbors are also sighing. There is no calling for the announcement room, but Maoling is asking for it. The wife sends him food, and the garden is not what it used to be. The spare fringes and curtains are here, and the wild wind is blowing in autumn. The swallow enters the non-side house, and the gull returns to the old pond. There is no double board on the broken bridge, and the lying willow grows its own branches. Then there is Shanyang's work, and I am ashamed of Bao Shuzhi. The plain friends are all gone, and the white head is full of tears."
现实,杜甫,春日江村五首,唐,农务村村急，春流岸岸深。乾坤万里眼，时序百年心。茅屋还堪赋，桃源自可寻。艰难贱生理，飘泊到如今。迢递来三蜀，蹉跎有六年。客身逢故旧，发兴自林泉。过懒从衣结，频游任履穿。藩篱无限景，恣意买江天。种竹交加翠，栽桃烂熳红。经心石镜月，到面雪山风。赤管随王命，银章付老翁。岂知牙齿落，名玷荐贤中。扶病垂朱绂，归休步紫苔。郊扉存晚计，幕府愧群材。燕外晴丝卷，鸥边水叶开。邻家送鱼鳖，问我数能来。群盗哀王粲，中年召贾生。登楼初有作，前席竟为荣。宅入先贤传，才高处士名。异时怀二子，春日复含情。,Reality,Du Fu,Five Poems of Kasuri Jiangcun,"Farming is in a hurry, and the shore of the spring is deep. The eyes of thousands of miles in the universe, the heart of a hundred years in time sequence. The thatched hut is still worthy of endowment, and the source of peaches can be found. Difficult and cheap physiology, drifting to this day. It's been six years since I came to Sanshu from afar. The guest is old and old, and his prosperity comes from Linquan. If you are too lazy, you will wear clothes and wear shoes frequently. The fence has unlimited scenery, and you can buy Jiangtian at will. Plant bamboo and add emerald green, and plant peaches and rotten red. The stone mirrors the moon with all my heart, and faces the snow mountain wind. The red tube follows the king's order, and the silver badge pays the old man. Did you know that the teeth are falling out, and the name is Jianxianzhong. Heal the sick and hang down the vermilion fur, return to rest and step on the purple moss. Suburbs keep late plans, and the shogunate is ashamed of its talents. The silk rolls outside the swallows, and the water leaves bloom beside the gulls. The neighbor sent fish and turtles and asked me how many I could come. The group of thieves mourned Wang Can, and the middle-aged called Jia Sheng. At the beginning of climbing the building, there was a work, but the front seat was actually proud. If you live in the biographies of the sages, you will be famous as a scholar. Pregnant with two sons at the same time, spring love again."
现实,杜甫,长江二首,唐,众水会涪万，瞿塘争一门。朝宗人共挹，盗贼尔谁尊。孤石隐如马，高萝垂饮猿。归心异波浪，何事即飞翻。浩浩终不息，乃知东极临。众流归海意，万国奉君心。色借潇湘阔，声驱滟滪深。未辞添雾雨，接上遇衣襟。,Reality,Du Fu,Two Songs of the Yangtze River,"All the waters will be flooded, and Qutang will fight for one. The people of the imperial family will fight together, but the thieves will be honored. The lone stone is hidden like a horse, and the high radish hangs down to drink from the ape. When you return to your heart, there are different waves, and whatever happens, you will fly over. Haohao will never stop, but he knows that the East is coming. All the streams return to the sea, and all nations serve the king's heart. The color borrows Xiaoxiang to be broad, and the sound drives Yan to deep. Don't say goodbye to the fog and rain, and connect to the skirt of the case."
现实,杜甫,承闻故房相公灵榇自阆州启殡归葬东都有作二首,唐,远闻房太守，归葬陆浑山。一德兴王后，孤魂久客间。孔明多故事，安石竟崇班。他日嘉陵涕，仍沾楚水还。丹旐飞飞日，初传发阆州。风尘终不解，江汉忽同流。剑动新身匣，书归故国楼。尽哀知有处，为客恐长休。,Reality,Du Fu,"It is said that the Linggu, the former minister of the house, was buried in Langzhou and returned to the east. There are two poems","Yuanwen Fang Taishou was buried in Luhun Mountain. Queen Dexing, a lonely soul for a long time. Kong Ming has many stories, but Anshi respects the class. In the future, Jialing's tears will still be stained with Chushui. Dan was flying to the sun, and it was first transmitted to Langzhou. The wind and the dust are finally puzzled, and Jiang Han suddenly flows together. The sword moves the new body box, and the book returns to the old country building. I know there is a place to do my sorrow, and I am afraid of being a guest for a long time."
现实,杜甫,将晓二首,唐,石城除击柝，铁锁欲开关。鼓角悲荒塞，星河落曙山。巴人常小梗，蜀使动无还。垂老孤帆色，飘飘犯百蛮。军吏回官烛，舟人自楚歌。寒沙蒙薄雾，落月去清波。壮惜身名晚，衰惭应接多。归朝日簪笏，筋力定如何。,Reality,Du Fu,will dawn two,"In addition to striking the watchman in Shicheng, the iron lock wants to be opened and closed. The drums and horns are sad and barren, and the stars and rivers are falling on Shushan Mountain. The Ba people are always small, and the envoys from Shu never returned. The old man looks lonely, flirtatious and violent. The military officials returned to the official candle, and the boatmen sang songs from Chu. The cold sand is covered with mist, and the falling moon goes to Shiba. It's a pity that Zhuang's name is late, and his decline should be more. Return to Asahi Zanhu, how the muscle strength will be."
现实,杜甫,怀锦水居止二首,唐,军旅西征僻，风尘战伐多。犹闻蜀父老，不忘舜讴歌。天险终难立，柴门岂重过。朝朝巫峡水，远逗锦江波。万里桥南宅，百花潭北庄。层轩皆面水，老树饱经霜。雪岭界天白，锦城曛日黄。惜哉形胜地，回首一茫茫。,Reality,Du Fu,Huai Jinshui is the only two poems,"The army marched to the west, and there were many battles in the wind and dust. I still hear about Shun's elders, and I don't forget to sing about Shun. The natural danger is difficult to stand in the end, and the chaimen is too heavy. Facing towards the water of Wu Gorge, teasing Jinjiang waves far away. Wanli Bridge South House, Baihuatan North Village. Layers of pavilions are all facing water, and old trees are full of frost. The sky is white in Xueling, and the sun is yellow in Jincheng. It's a pity that it's a scenic spot, looking back at the vastness."
现实,杜甫,不离西阁二首,唐,江柳非时发，江花冷色频。地偏应有瘴，腊近已含春。失学从愚子，无家住老身。不知西阁意，肯别定留人。西阁从人别，人今亦故亭。江云飘素练，石壁断空青。沧海先迎日，银河倒列星。平生耽胜事，吁骇始初经。,Reality,Du Fu,Never leave the West Pavilion,"The willows are out of season, and the flowers in the river are cold and frequent. There should be miasma on the ground, and the wax is almost full of spring. Out of school, from a fool, without a home to live in old age. I don't know the intention of Xige, so I definitely don't want to keep people. The West Pavilion is farewell to others, and people are also old pavilions today. Jiang Yunpiao is practicing, and the stone wall is broken and empty. The sea greets the sun first, and the Milky Way reverses the stars. All my life, I have been in the victories, and I have been appalled at the beginning of the classics."
现实,杜甫,入宅三首,唐,奔峭背赤甲，断崖当白盐。客居愧迁次，春酒渐多添。花亚欲移竹，鸟窥新捲帘。衰年不敢恨，胜概欲相兼。乱后居难定，春归客未还。水生鱼复浦，云暖麝香山。半顶梳头白，过眉拄杖斑。相看多使者，一一问函关。宋玉归州宅，云通白帝城。吾人淹老病，旅食岂才名。峡口风常急，江流气不平。只应与儿子，飘转任浮生。,Reality,Du Fu,Three poems about entering the house,"Ben Qiao back red armor, cliffs as white salt. As a guest, I am ashamed to move, and the spring wine is gradually added. Huaya wants to move the bamboo, and the bird peeps at the new roller blind. Don't dare to hate in old age, and want to win and win. After the chaos, it is difficult to settle down, and the spring returnee has not yet returned. Aquatic fish return to Pu, and clouds warm Musk Mountain. Half of the combed hair is white, and the eyebrows are marked with sticks. Look at many envoys, ask letters one by one. Song Yu returned to the state house, and Yuntong Baidi City. We are drowning in old age and sickness, so what is the name of travel and food? The wind at the mouth of the gorge is often anxious, and the flow of the river is uneven. You should only be with your son, drifting to be a floating life."
现实,杜甫,暮春题瀼西新赁草屋五首,唐,久嗟三峡客，再与暮春期。百舌欲无语，繁花能几时。谷虚云气薄，波乱日华迟。战伐何由定，哀伤不在兹。此邦千树橘，不见比封君。养拙干戈际，全生麋鹿群。畏人江北草，旅食瀼西云。万里巴渝曲，三年实饱闻。綵云阴复白，锦树晓来青。身世双蓬鬓，乾坤一草亭。哀歌时自短，醉舞为谁醒。细雨荷锄立，江猿吟翠屏。壮年学书剑，他日委泥沙。事主非无禄，浮生即有涯。高斋依药饵，绝域改春华。丧乱丹心破，王臣未一家。欲陈济世策，已老尚书郎。未息豺虎斗，空惭鸳鹭行。时危人事急，风逆羽毛伤。落日悲江汉，中宵泪满床。,Reality,Du Fu,Five Poems on Renting a Thatched Cottage in Xixin in Late Spring,"have been a guest of the Three Gorges for a long time, and then I will be with you in late spring. A hundred tongues want to be speechless, how long will the flowers last. The valley is empty, the clouds are thin, the waves are chaotic, and the sun is late. Why is the war determined, and the sorrow is not here. There are thousands of orange trees in this state, but there is no comparison to Fengjun. Raising clumsy and fighting against each other, the whole elk herd. Afraid of people Jiangbei grass, travel and eat like Xiyun. Wanli Bayu song has been heard for three years. The colorful clouds are overcast and white, and the brocade trees are green at dawn. Born with double hair on the temples, and a grass pavilion in heaven and earth. The lament is short, for whom does the drunken dance wake up. The lotus hoe stands in the drizzle, and the river ape sings on the green screen. A man in his prime learns calligraphy and swords, but in the future he will be ashamed. The owner is not without salary, and there is a limit to a floating life. Gao Zhai relies on the bait to transform the absolute domain into Chunhua. Sangluan's heart is broken, and Wangchen has no family. If you want Chen Ji Shice, you are old Shang Shulang. Jackals and tigers fight without rest, mandarin ducks and herons walk in emptiness. Times are in danger, people are in a hurry, and the wind is against the feathers. The setting sun mourns Jianghan, and the bed is full of tears in the middle of the night."

The boats are connected to the wild wells, and the Buzhai Chu Village Ruins. When the jujube is cooked, people beat it, and the sunflower wants to hoe it by itself. The old man's food is served on a plate, divided into fish and stream fish. It is easy to understand the physiology of floating, but it is difficult to teach one thing to violate. Deep water fish bliss, Lin Mao birds know their home. I am old, poor and sick, and there are right and wrong in prosperity. The autumn wind blows a few sticks, and I never tire of the mountain weeping. Ritual and music attack my shortcomings, and the mountains and forests lead to prosperity. Turn around the gauze hat flat, exposure back bamboo book light. Feng Luo collects pine nuts, Tian Han cuts honeycombs. Sparse small red emeralds, slightly fragrant near the clogs. The autumn sand on the far shore is white, and the mountains are red at night. Hidden scales lose the stormy waves, returning wings will be high winds. The sound of the anvil is heard in every family, and the sound of woodcutters is all the same. Feishuang was appointed as a young girl, and she was given to be separated from Nangong. The body is painted with unicorns, and the flock of mandarin ducks declines every year. The big river is easy to flourish in autumn, and the empty gorge is heard a lot at night. A thousand stones are hidden in the path, and a cloud is left in the sail. Children do not need to join the army to understand barbarian language."

The back hall is remote, and the wild is prosperous. The mountain pheasant defends against the enemy, and the river ape should chant alone. If you don't let the clouds go high, you have no intention of hiding. It is cold and early in the gullies, and the long forest is full of fog. The caterpillar hangs in the sun, and the red fruit falls into the mud. Thin vulgarity guards against human face, and the whole body learns from horseshoes. Sit and look back while reciting poems, and feel free to lower your Gejin. Where does the weak fence go, the sandy shore will only be destroyed. The fish are more hungry in the sun, and the birds are still coming. The light in the cold water is difficult to fix, and the sound of autumn mountains is easy to mourn. The end of the world is a little dark, and it's even more difficult to lean on the stick."

The flat land and river are stable, and the high mountains are the same on all sides. Smoke and frost are desolate days, and japonica rice is ripe in the wind. In the event of personnel injuries, I will guard Gui Cong. The east village is complex to the west, and the other lives in Qingxi. To and fro are all thatched huts, flooded and left as rice paddies. The noise of the city should be close to the profit, and the forest is secluded. If you visit Shuai Wengyu, you must make the remaining guests confused. Daobei Feng Dushi, Gaozhai saw Yichuan. Zi can drain fine stones, and I also marsh clear springs. The pillow belt is still similar, and Chai Jing is there. It takes days to cut She, but I don't know how many years to untie. It falls firmly outside the West River, and is scattered among the northern households. After traveling in Bazi country for a long time, he fell ill in Churen Mountain. The secluded and lonely place moves to a better place, and the clear and deep are separated by a long distance. Seeing mandarin ducks in the cold sky, looking back and recalling the morning class."

I don't have many houses, but luckily it doesn't hinder Yunshan. Yu Chi invades the cold air, and tastes the new and broken travel face. There are red and fresh all day long, but the jade grains are not for me. Rice can be cooked white, and okra can be boiled again. Who is slippery and easy to be full, always soft and well-balanced. Fortunately, Fangzhou is ripe, and Miao is the same as Yiquechun. No labor Yingqu bowl, its own color is like silver."
现实,杜甫,从驿次草堂复至东屯二首,唐,峡内归田客，江边借马骑。非寻戴安道，似向习家池。峡险风烟僻，天寒橘柚垂。筑场看敛积，一学楚人为。短景难高卧，衰年强此身。山家蒸栗暖，野饭射麋新。世路知交薄，门庭畏客频。牧童斯在眼，田父实为邻。,Reality,Du Fu,Returning from Yici Thatched Cottage to Dongtun Erpoem,"Returning to the fields in the gorge, borrowing horses to ride by the river. Instead of looking for Di'an Road, it seems to be looking for Xijiachi. The gorge is dangerous, windy and smokey, and the sky is cold, and oranges and pomelo are hanging down. Build a field to see accumulation, and learn from Chu people. It is difficult to lie high in a short scene, and the body is strong in old age. The chestnuts are steamed in the mountains to warm them up, and the elk are freshly shot with picnic rice. There are few friends in the world, and the family is afraid of frequent customers. The shepherd boy is here, but Tian's father is actually a neighbor."
现实,杜甫,峡口二首,唐,峡口大江间，西南控百蛮。城欹连粉堞，岸断更青山。开辟多天险，防隅一水关。乱离闻鼓角，秋气动衰颜。时清关失险，世乱戟如林。去矣英雄事，荒哉割据心。芦花留客晚，枫树坐猿深。疲薾烦亲故，诸侯数赐金。,Reality,Du Fu,Gap Two,"Between the gorge mouth and the big river, the southwest controls a hundred barbarians. The city is connected to the powder battlements, and the shore is broken to become more green mountains. Open up many natural dangers, and guard against one water pass. Luanli hears drums and horns, autumn air moves and fades. When customs clearance is in danger, the world is in chaos. Going to do heroic things, it's ridiculous to cut off your heart. The reeds stay late, the maple sits deep. Tired and annoying relatives, the princes gave gold several times."
现实,杜甫,覆舟二首,唐,巫峡盘涡晓，黔阳贡物秋。丹砂同陨石，翠羽共沈舟。羁使空斜影，龙居閟积流。篙工幸不溺，俄顷逐轻鸥。竹宫时望拜，桂馆或求仙。姹女临波日，神光照夜年。徒闻斩蛟剑，无复爨犀船。使者随秋色，迢迢独上天。,Reality,Du Fu,Capturing the Boat Two Poems,"The vortex dawns in Wu Gorge, and the tributes in Qianyang fall. The cinnabar is the same as the meteorite, and the green feather sinks the boat together. The restraint makes the sky slant, and the dragon lives in the accumulation. Fortunately, the pole workers did not drown, and Russia chased the light gulls. When visiting the Bamboo Palace, you may visit the Gui Pavilion or ask for immortals. Girls face the waves in the day, and the gods shine in the evening. It is only heard that the dragon sword is cut, and the rhinoceros boat is no longer there. The messenger followed the autumn scenery and went to the sky alone."

The water falls coldly on the shore, and the mountain birds pass through the court at dusk. Warm the old beard Yanyu, fill the hunger and recall Chuping. Hu Jia was upstairs, mourning unbearably. The white dog is slanting to the north, and the ox is even more east. The clouds in the gorge always shine at night, and the moon in the river will also be windy. The old man who is drying the medicine is an old man, and he should try the little boy at the door. I also know that I can't catch it, and I hate how deaf my ears are."

Bi knows the grass outside the lake, red sees Haidong clouds. The warblers are in harmony with each other every day, and there are many groups of cranes on the sky. The wild flowers are more dry and falling, and the wind is rushing. Crowing crows compete for introductions, and singing cranes do not return to the forest. Gao Fei hates Jiu Yin when he eats and is muddy. The sound of rain rushed to the top, and the sun shot deep into the river. Looking back at Zhou Nanke, driving Wei Quexin."
现实,杜甫,月三首,唐,断续巫山雨，天河此夜新。若无青嶂月，愁杀白头人。魍魉移深树，虾蟆动半轮。故园当北斗，直指照西秦。并照巫山出，新窥楚水清。羁栖愁里见，二十四回明。必验升沈体，如知进退情。不违银汉落，亦伴玉绳横。万里瞿塘峡，春来六上弦。时时开暗室，故故满青天。爽合风襟静，高当泪脸悬。南飞有乌鹊，夜久落江边。,Reality,Du Fu,month three,"Intermittent rain in Wushan, Tianhe is new this night.

It is necessary to test the ups and downs of the body, such as knowing how to advance and retreat. It does not violate the fall of the silver man, and it is also accompanied by the jade rope. Thousands of miles of Qutang Gorge, spring comes six winding. The dark room is always open, so the sky is full of blue sky. The wind is cool and the lapel is quiet, and Gao Dang's face hangs with tears. There are black magpies flying south, and they fall to the riverside after a long night."
现实,杜甫,热三首,唐,雷霆空霹雳，云雨竟虚无。炎赫衣流汗，低垂气不苏。乞为寒水玉，愿作冷秋菰。何似儿童岁，风凉出舞雩。瘴云终不灭，泸水复西来。闭户人高卧，归林鸟却回。峡中都似火，江上只空雷。想见阴宫雪，风门飒踏开。朱李沈不冷，彫胡炊屡新。将衰骨尽痛，被褐味空频。歘翕炎蒸景，飘飖征戍人。十年可解甲，为尔一沾巾。,Reality,Du Fu,hot three,"The thunderbolt is empty, and the clouds and rain are nothing. Yan Heyi was sweating, drooping and breathless. Begging for cold water jade, willing to be cold autumn wild rice. It's like a child's age, and the wind is cool to dance. The cloud of miasma will never be extinguished, and Lushui will return to the west. The closed door people lie down high, but the birds return to the forest. Everything in the gorge is like fire, and there is only thunder on the river. Wanting to see Yin Gongxue, the damper is stepped open. Zhu Lichen is not cold, and there are new carvings and cooks. It will make the bones suffer from pain, and the brown smell will be empty. The scene is steaming with inflammation, and the soldiers are conquered by the wind. It can be disarmed in ten years, and it will be a towel for you."
现实,杜甫,八月十五夜月二首,唐,满目飞明镜，归心折大刀。转蓬行地远，攀桂仰天高。水路疑霜雪，林栖见羽毛。此时瞻白兔，直欲数秋毫。稍下巫山峡，犹衔白帝城。气沈全浦暗，轮仄半楼明。刁斗皆催晓，蟾蜍且自倾。张弓倚残魄，不独汉家营。,Reality,Du Fu,August 15 Night Moon Two Poems,"Flying mirrors everywhere, returning to the heart to fold the sword. Turning the peng and traveling far away, climbing the osmanthus and looking up to the sky. The waterway is suspicious of frost and snow, and the forest habitat sees feathers. At this time, looking at the white rabbit, I want to count the autumn hairs. A little below Wushan Gorge, you still have the title of Baidi City. The air is sinking, the whole Pu is dark, and the wheel is flat and half of the building is bright. Diao Dou reminds the dawn, and the toad is self-indulgent. Zhang Gong relied on his remnant soul, not alone in the camp of the Han family."
现实,杜甫,雨四首,唐,微雨不滑道，断云疏复行。紫崖奔处黑，白鸟去边明。秋日新沾影，寒江旧落声。柴扉临野碓，半得捣香粳。江雨旧无时，天晴忽散丝。暮秋沾物冷，今日过云迟。上马迥休出，看鸥坐不辞。高轩当滟滪，润色静书帷。物色岁将晏，天隅人未归。朔风鸣淅淅，寒雨下霏霏。多病久加饭，衰容新授衣。时危觉凋丧，故旧短书稀。楚雨石苔滋，京华消息迟。山寒青兕叫，江晚白鸥饥。神女花钿落，鲛人织杼悲。繁忧不自整，终日洒如丝。,Reality,Du Fu,rain four,"The light rain does not slide, and the clouds are broken and the journey is repeated. Ziya rushes to the black, and the white bird goes to the bright side. In autumn, the shadows are new, and the cold river is old. Chai Fei is close to the wild pestle, half of which is smashed with fragrant japonica. The rain in the river is old and endless, and the sky is sunny and loose. It's cold in late autumn, and it's too late today. Get on the horse and go out, watching the gulls sit without saying goodbye. Gao Xuan is in the twilight, embellishing the quiet book curtain. Looking for the old general Yan, Tianyu people have not returned. The new wind is whistling, and the cold rain is falling. If you are sick and have been sick for a long time, you will add food, and you will get new clothes when your appearance fades. The time is dangerous and withered, so the old short books are rare. Chu Yu stone moss grows, news from Jinghua is late. The mountains are cold and green, and the white gulls are hungry in the evening of the river. The goddess's flowers fall, and the sharks weave their sorrows. The worries are not self-organized, and they are sprinkled like silk all day long."
现实,杜甫,朝二首,唐,清旭楚宫南，霜空万岭含。野人时独往，云木晓相参。俊鹘无声过，饥乌下食贪。病身终不动，摇落任江潭。浦帆晨初发，郊扉冷未开。村疏黄叶坠，野静白鸥来。础润休全湿，云晴欲半回。巫山冬可怪，昨夜有奔雷。,Reality,Du Fu,chao er shou,"In the south of Chugong in the early Qing Dynasty, the frosty sky contains ten thousand mountains. When the savage went alone, Yun Muxiao joined each other. The handsome falcon passed silently, hungry and greedy. He died of illness and remained motionless, and was shaken to the rivers and lakes. The sails of Pufan are early in the morning, and the suburbs are still cold. The yellow leaves of the village are falling, and the wild white gulls are coming.

There is no fixed deer on Haoshan Mountain, and cicadas are startled by falling trees. Temporarily recall Jiangdong carp, and get off the boat with snow. Man Ge offends the stars, and the sky feels empty. The city walls are sad, and the village ruins are sparse. Jiabing has been around for a long time, and the Fu collects and returns late at night. The dark trees fall by the rocks, and the bright river surrounds the fortress slightly. Dou Xie people look more, the moon is fine and the magpie stops flying."
现实,杜甫,社日两篇,唐,九农成德业，百祀发光辉。报效神如在，馨香旧不违。南翁巴曲醉，北雁塞声微。尚想东方朔，诙谐割肉归。陈平亦分肉，太史竟论功。今日江南老，他时渭北童。欢娱看绝塞，涕泪落秋风。鸳鹭回金阙，谁怜病峡中。,Reality,Du Fu,Newsletter,"Nine farms become virtuous, and hundreds of sacrifices shine brightly. Serve God as if there is a fragrance that is old. Weng Baqu in the south is drunk, and the geese in the north are silent. I still think of Dongfang Shuo, and I am humorous and cut my flesh. Chen Ping also divides meat, and Tai Shi actually discusses merit. Today Jiangnan is an old man, but he was a boy in Weibei. Jubilant to see Jusai, tears fall in the autumn wind. The mandarin heron returns to Jinque, who pities the sick in the gorge."

Cornus officinalis is a rare gift for courtiers. Old and Su Siye, also with Zheng Guangwen. The fragrance of picking flowers is widespread, and the guests are drunk. The wild tree song is still leaning, but the autumn anvil wakes up but smells it. There are two dark deserts for joy and entertainment, and there are lonely clouds in the northwest. Chongyang drank the wine in his glass alone, got sick and went to the stage on the river. Bamboo leaves have no distinction between people, and chrysanthemums do not need to bloom from now on. On the other side, Xuanyuan cries at sunset, and white geese come before the frost in the old country. Brother and sister are in depression, where will they go, and the two are urging each other to fight and decline."

Every family raises tortoises and eats yellow croakers every now and then. Old knowledge can become a state, and new knowledge has been dimmed. Governance and plowing, only do not close the canal. Qingqiang Ban in the west and Baidi City in the south. Yu Tu invades the guest and hates it, so he treats it as a favor. Wab conveys the divine language, and Shetian Feihuo sounds.

The eaves are decorated with embroidered sections, and the waist is bulged with golden flowers. A man dances the sword first, and then sings the woodcutter after a hundred plays. Jiangshu City is lonely and far away, and the cloud platform makes it lonely. The Han Dynasty frequently elected generals, and they should pay homage to Huo and Yao."

The old man insisted on sitting and watching the king because of his alcoholism. The bright moon grows well, and the floating clouds gradually cover it. Take a leisurely look at the frontier fortress, and quietly recall Jinghua. Clear the contents of the cup and check with the sea. Sleepless looking at the white rabbit, a hundred times falling black yarn. There is no wine on the moon, and there is a river when you go upstairs.

The pool is a mountain with simple horses, and the moon is clean with Yugong Tower. Erase Yu Pianhan, a fishing boat in his life. Gaotang cold wave less, as if knowing Zhaoqiu. The new house by the lake has been visited by guests. You have to open the bamboo path, who can avoid the clouds. The official order is Pan Shengzhuo, and his talent is Jia Fuduo. The boat should be turned around, what is the intention of adjacency. Stopping Penglai Pavilion for a while, and eventually becoming a Jianghai native.

The bamboo song is not ready, so don't come back later. Luggage is a gift of gold, and the clothes are eight feet long. Fei Teng knows a strategy, and his intentions are not without spirit. The rank of the class is also the noble, and the prince is a stranger. Xuancheng loses literary talent, and the world's career will not sink."
现实,杜甫,人日二首,唐,元日到人日，未有不阴时。冰雪莺难至，春寒花较迟。云随白水落，风振紫山悲。蓬鬓稀疏久，无劳比素丝。此日此时人共得，一谈一笑俗相看。尊前柏叶休随酒，胜里金花巧耐寒。佩剑冲星聊暂拔，匣琴流水自须弹。早春重引江湖兴，直道无忧行路难。,Reality,Du Fu,People's Day Two Songs,"From the first day to the human day, there is no time when it is not cloudy. The ice and snow warblers are hard to come, and the flowers are late in the cold spring. The cloud falls with the white water, and the wind vibrates the purple mountain with sorrow. The hair on the temples is sparse for a long time, and there is no labor ratio silk. This day and this time, everyone gets it together, talk and laugh with each other. The cypress leaves in front of the statue rest with the wine, and the golden flowers in Shengli are clever and cold-resistant. The saber rushes to the stars and chats for a while, but the violin and flowing water must be played by itself. In early spring, the rivers and lakes are revitalized, and the straight road is difficult to travel without worry."
现实,杜甫,江边星月二首,唐,骤雨清秋夜，金波耿玉绳。天河元自白，江浦向来澄。映物连珠断，缘空一镜升。馀光隐更漏，况乃露华凝。江月辞风缆，江星别雾船。鸡鸣还曙色，鹭浴自清川。历历竟谁种，悠悠何处圆。客愁殊未已，他夕始相鲜。,Reality,Du Fu,Two Songs of Star and Moon by the River,"Showers clear autumn night, Jin Bo Geng Yu rope. Tianhe Yuan confessed, Jiangpu has always been clear. The reflection of things is broken, and the edge of the sky is lifted by a mirror. Yu Guangyin is more leaky, and the situation is Luhua Ning. Jiang Yue bids farewell to the wind cable, and Jiang Xing bids farewell to the fog boat. The crowing of the cock is still the dawn, and the egret bathes in Qingchuan. Lili actually who planted, where to round. The guest's worries are endless, and he never sees each other every evening."
现实,杜甫,宴王使君宅题二首,唐,汉主追韩信，苍生起谢安。吾徒自漂泊，世事各艰难。逆旅招邀近，他乡思绪宽。不材甘朽质，高卧岂泥蟠。泛爱容霜发，留欢卜夜閒。自吟诗送老，相劝酒开颜。戎马今何地，乡园独旧山。江湖堕清月，酩酊任扶还。,Reality,Du Fu,Two Inscriptions on Banqueting the King's Envoy's House,"The Lord of the Han Dynasty pursued Han Xin, and the common people raised Xie An. I am wandering alone, and the world is difficult. Adverse travel invites near, and the thoughts of foreign lands are wide. If you are not talented, you will not be willing to decay, but if you lie high, you will be muddy. Pan loves face and hair, stays happy and idle at night. Recite poems to send off old age, and persuade each other to cheer up with wine. Where are the soldiers and horses now? The village is alone in the old mountains. The rivers and lakes fall into the clear moon, and they will be helped back when they are drunk."
现实,杜甫,哭李常侍峄二首,唐,一代风流尽，修文地下深。斯人不重见，将老失知音。短日行梅岭，寒山落桂林。长安若个畔，犹想映貂金。青琐陪双入，铜梁阻一辞。风尘逢我地，江汉哭君时。次第寻书札，呼儿检赠诗。发挥王子表，不愧史臣词。,Reality,Du Fu,Two Songs of Crying by Li Changshi,"A generation of romance is exhausted, and Xiuwen goes deep underground. Sri Lankan people do not see each other, and they will lose their minds when they are old. Travel to Meiling for a short day, and fall to Guilin in the cold mountains. If Chang'an is like a bank, I still want to reflect Diao Jin. Qing Suo accompanied the two to enter, and Tongliang blocked a speech. When the wind and the dust meet my land, when Jianghan cries for the king. The next time I searched for books and letters, Hu Erjian presented poems. Playing Wang Zibiao is worthy of Shi Chen's words."
现实,杜甫,归雁二首,唐,万里衡阳雁，今年又北归。双双瞻客上，一一背人飞。云里相呼疾，沙边自宿稀。系书元浪语，愁寂故山薇。欲雪违胡地，先花别楚云。却过清渭影，高起洞庭群。塞北春阴暮，江南日色曛。伤弓流落羽，行断不堪闻。,Reality,Du Fu,Returning Goose Two Poems,"Thousands of miles of Hengyang geese have returned to the north this year. Both look at the guests, one by one fly with their backs. In the clouds, each other shouts at each other, and the sand is sparsely populated. The series is written in the language of Yuan Lang, and the old Shan Wei is sad and lonely. If you want snow to go against the ground, first spend farewell to Chu Yun. But passing through the shadow of Qing Wei, the Dongting Group rises high. Spring is cloudy in northern Saibei, and the sun is shining in the south of the Yangtze River. The bow is injured and the feathers are shed, and the behavior is unbearable."
现实,杜甫,巴西驿亭观江涨呈窦使君二首,唐,转惊波作怒，即恐岸随流。赖有杯中物，还同海上鸥。关心小剡县，傍眼见扬州。为接情人饮，朝来减半愁。向晚波微绿，连空岸脚青。日兼春有暮，愁与醉无醒。漂泊犹杯酒，踌躇此驿亭。相看万里外，同是一浮萍。,Reality,Du Fu,Watching the River at a Post Pavilion in Brazil,"Turn the startled waves into anger, that is to say, the shore will follow the current with fear. It depends on what is in the cup, and it is also the same as the seagull. Care about Xiaoshan County, and see Yangzhou with your own eyes. In order to meet the lover and drink, the worries of the dynasty will be halved. In the evening, the waves are slightly green, and even the feet of the empty bank are green. Day and spring have dusk, worry and drunkenness. Wandering is like a glass of wine, hesitating in this post pavilion. Looking thousands of miles away, they are the same duckweed."
现实,杜甫,曲江二首,唐,一片花飞减却春，风飘万点正愁人。且看欲尽花经眼，莫厌伤多酒入唇。江上小堂巢翡翠，花边高冢卧麒麟。细推物理须行乐，何用浮名绊此身。朝回日日典春衣，每日江头尽醉归。酒债寻常行处有，人生七十古来稀。穿花蛱蝶深深见，点水蜻蜓款款飞。传语风光共流转，暂时相赏莫相违。,Reality,Du Fu,Qujiang Two Poems,"A piece of flowers fly away to reduce the spring, and the wind is full of sorrows. And look at the eyes, don't get tired of drinking too much wine into your lips. Emeralds nest in the small hall on the river, and unicorns lie on lace high mounds. If you push physics carefully, you must enjoy yourself, so why use false names to trip this body. North Korea returns to the Japanese spring clothes, and the Jiangtou returns drunk every day. Liquor debts are common in places, but rare in life at seventy. The butterfly wearing the flower sees deeply, and the dragonfly flying on the water. Rumors and scenery flow together, and there is no contradiction in rewarding each other for the time being."
现实,杜甫,至日遣兴奉寄北省旧阁老两院故人二首,唐,去岁兹辰捧御床，五更三点入鹓行。欲知趋走伤心地，正想氛氲满眼香。无路从容陪语笑，有时颠倒著衣裳。何人错忆穷愁日，愁日愁随一线长。忆昨逍遥供奉班，去年今日侍龙颜。麒麟不动炉烟上，孔雀徐开扇影还。玉几由来天北极，朱衣只在殿中间。孤城此日堪肠断，愁对寒云雪满山。,Reality,Du Fu,"At the end of the day, send Xing and send two poems to the deceased in the old pavilion and the old courtyard of the northern province","Last year, Zichen held the imperial bed, and went to the bait at five o'clock. If you want to know, you will go away sadly, and you are thinking that the atmosphere is full of fragrance. Wulu calmly laughs with Yuyu, sometimes turning his clothes upside down. Who wrongly remembers the days of poverty and sorrow, and the sorrow of the days of sorrow follows the long line. Recalling yesterday's Xiaoyao enshrining class, and serving Longyan today last year. The unicorn does not move on the stove smoke, and the peacock slowly opens its fan to return. The jade table comes from the north pole of the sky, and the red clothes are only in the middle of the hall. The lonely city is heartbroken today, and the mountains are covered with cold clouds and snow."
现实,杜甫,十二月一日三首,唐,今朝腊月春意动，云安县前江可怜。一声何处送书雁，百丈谁家上水船。未将梅蕊惊愁眼，要取楸花媚远天。明光起草人所羡，肺病几时朝日边。寒轻市上山烟碧，日满楼前江雾黄。负盐出井此溪女，打鼓发船何郡郎。新亭举目风景切，茂陵著书消渴长。春花不愁不烂漫，楚客唯听棹相将。即看燕子入山扉，岂有黄鹂历翠微。短短桃花临水岸，轻轻柳絮点人衣。春来准拟开怀久，老去亲知见面稀。他日一杯难强进，重嗟筋力故山违。,Reality,Du Fu,three songs on december 1st,"At present, the twelfth lunar month is full of spring, and Qianjiang in Yun'an County is pitiful. Where to send the book geese, whoever gets on the boat at a hundred feet. Mei Rui was not frightened and worried, but wanted to take catalpa to charm the distant sky. The envy of the drafters of Mingguang, when lung disease will come to the sun. In Hanqing City, the mountains are cloudy and green, and the sun is full and the river in front of the building is yellow with fog. Negative salt came out of the well, and the girl of the stream beat the drums and sent the boat to He Junlang. The new pavilion looks up to see the scenery, and Maoling writes books to quench his thirst. The spring flowers are not worrying or blooming, Chu Ke only listens to Xiang Xiangjiang. That is to say, seeing swallows entering the mountain gate, how can there be an oriole Li Cuiwei. The short peach blossoms are near the water bank, and the catkins are lightly dotted on people's clothes. In spring, I plan to be happy for a long time, but when I get old, it is rare to meet friends and acquaintances. In the future, it will be difficult to forcibly advance with a cup, and the strength of the muscles will be so heavy."
现实,杜甫,秋兴八首,唐,玉露凋伤枫树林，巫山巫峡气萧森。江间波浪兼天涌，塞上风云接地阴。丛菊两开他日泪，孤舟一系故园心。寒衣处处催刀尺，白帝城高急暮砧。夔府孤城落日斜，每依南斗望京华。听猿实下三声泪，奉使虚随八月查。画省香炉违伏枕，山楼粉堞隐悲笳。请看石上藤萝月，已映洲前芦荻花。千家山郭静朝晖，一日江楼坐翠微。信宿渔人还汎汎，清秋燕子故飞飞。匡衡抗疏功名薄，刘向传经心事违。同学少年多不贱，五陵衣马自轻肥。闻道长安似弈棋，百年世事不胜悲。王侯第宅皆新主，文武衣冠异昔时。直北关山金鼓振，征西车马羽书迟。鱼龙寂寞秋江冷，故国平居有所思。蓬莱宫阙对南山，承露金茎霄汉间。西望瑶池降王母，东来紫气满函关。云移雉尾开宫扇，日绕龙鳞识圣颜。一卧沧江惊岁晚，几回青琐照朝班。瞿唐峡口曲江头，万里风烟接素秋。花萼夹城通御气，芙蓉小苑入边愁。朱帘绣柱围黄鹤，锦缆牙樯起白鸥。回首可怜歌舞地，秦中自古帝王州。昆明池水汉时功，武帝旌旗在眼中。织女机丝虚月夜，石鲸鳞甲动秋风。波漂菰米沈云黑，露冷莲房坠粉红。关塞极天唯鸟道，江湖满地一渔翁。昆吾御宿自逶迤，紫阁峰阴入渼陂。香稻啄馀鹦鹉粒，碧梧栖老凤皇枝。佳人拾翠春相问，仙侣同舟晚更移。綵笔昔游干气象，白头吟望苦低垂。,Reality,Du Fu,Qiuxing Eight Poems,"The jade dew withers the maple forest, and the Wu Gorge in Wushan is bleak. The waves in the river and the sky are surging, and the wind and clouds are on the plug and the ground is cloudy. Cong Ju shed tears for the future, and the lonely boat is the heart of the hometown. The cold clothes urge the knife and ruler everywhere, and the Baidi City is high and anxious. The setting sun is slanting in the isolated city of Kui's mansion, and every time I look at the capital from the south. Hearing the ape shed tears three times, he was envoys to investigate in August. The censer of the painting province is hidden behind the pillow, and the powder wall of the mountain tower is sad. Please look at the vines on the stone and the moon, which has already reflected the reed flowers in front of the continent. Qianjiashan Guojing Zhaohui, one day Jianglou sits in Cuiwei. The fisherman of Xinsu is still ordinary, and the swallows are flying in the Qingqiu. Kuang Heng's fame and reputation are poor, and Liu Xiangchuan has violated his mind. Classmates are young and not cheap, and Wuling's clothes and horses are self-deprecating and fat. It is said that Chang'an is like playing chess, and the world is full of sorrows for a hundred years. The residences of princes and marquises are all new owners, and their civil and military clothes are different from those of the past. The golden drums in Guanshan in the straight north vibrated, and it was late to conquer the western chariots, horses, feathers and books. The fish and the dragon are lonely, the autumn river is cold, and the homeland lives in peace. The Penglai Palace faces Nanshan Mountain, and the exposed golden stems are in the Han Dynasty. Looking west at Yaochi, the queen mother descended, and from the east came Ziqi Manhan Pass. The cloud moved the tail of the pheasant and opened the palace fan, and the sun circled the dragon scale to recognize the holy face. Once lying in the Cangjiang River, the age was frightened, and Qing Suo took the morning shift several times. At the head of the Qujiang River at the mouth of the Qutang Gorge, thousands of miles of wind and smoke meet Suqiu. The calyx clips the city to pass the imperial energy, and the small hibiscus garden enters the border to worry. Red curtains and embroidered pillars surround yellow cranes, and brocade cable teeth and masts raise white gulls. Looking back on the poor singing and dancing place, Qinzhong has been the emperor state since ancient times. Kunming Chishui Han Shigong, Emperor Wu's flag is in his eyes. The silk of the weaving girl looms in the moonlit night, and the scales of stone whales move the autumn wind. The wild rice in waves is dark and cloudy black, and the lotus pods in Luleng are pink. There are only bird paths in the extreme sky of Guansai, and the rivers and lakes are full of fishermen. Kunwu Royal Residence is meandering, and Zige Peak is shaded into Mipi. Fragrant rice pecks the remaining parrot grains, and Biwu perches on the old phoenix emperor branch. The beautiful woman picks up the green spring and asks each other, and the fairy couple moves later in the same boat. Colored pens used to travel dry weather, bald heads groaning and looking down bitterly."
现实,杜甫,咏怀古迹五首,唐,支离东北风尘际，漂泊西南天地间。三峡楼台淹日月，五溪衣服共云山。羯胡事主终无赖，词客哀时且未还。庾信平生最萧瑟，暮年诗赋动江关。摇落深知宋玉悲，风流儒雅亦吾师。怅望千秋一洒泪，萧条异代不同时。江山故宅空文藻，云雨荒台岂梦思。最是楚宫俱泯灭，舟人指点到今疑。群山万壑赴荆门，生长明妃尚有村。一去紫台连朔漠，独留青冢向黄昏。画图省识春风面，环佩空归月夜魂。千载琵琶作胡语，分明怨恨曲中论。蜀主窥吴幸三峡，崩年亦在永安宫。翠华想像空山里，玉殿虚无野寺中。古庙杉松巢水鹤，岁时伏腊走村翁。武侯祠屋常邻近，一体君臣祭祀同。诸葛大名垂宇宙，宗臣遗像肃清高。三分割据纡筹策，万古云霄一羽毛。伯仲之间见伊吕，指挥若定失萧曹。福移汉祚难恢复，志决身歼军务劳。,Reality,Du Fu,Five Poems of Worshiping Historic Sites,"Detached from the wind and dust in the northeast, wandering between the heaven and the earth in the southwest. The sun and the moon are flooded by the towers of the Three Gorges, and the clothes of the five streams are all clouds and mountains. The owner of Jiehu is a rogue, and the poet has not returned it when he is mourning. Yu Xin was the most bleak in his life, and his poems and prose in his later years moved Jiangguan. Shake Luo knows Song Yubei well, and he is also my teacher when he is elegant and elegant. Desperate to look forward to the tears of Qianqiu, the depression is different from generation to generation. Jiangshan's former residence is empty of literary algae, and the clouds and rain are barren and the terrace is unimaginable. The most important thing is that the palace of Chu was completely wiped out, and the people in the boat still doubted what they pointed out. The mountains and valleys go to Jingmen, and there is still a village for the concubine of the Ming Dynasty. Once I went to Zitai and even Shuomo, I left the green mound alone to the dusk. Draw a picture to understand the spring breeze, and wear the sky to return to the soul of the moon night. Pipa has been used as Hu language for thousands of years, clearly resenting the theory in the song. The Lord of Shu peeped at the Three Gorges of Wu Xing, and he was also in Yong'an Palace in the year of Bengnian. Cuihua imagines the empty mountain, the jade hall and the empty temple. The water crane nests in fir and pine in the ancient temple, and the village old man walks in Fula every year. The ancestral halls of Marquis Wu are often adjacent to each other, where the monarch and his ministers offer sacrifices together. Zhuge's name hangs down to the universe, and the portraits of Zongchen's portraits are clear and high. According to the planning and planning of the three divisions, there is a feather in the eternal sky. Seeing Yilu between brothers and sisters, the commander is sure to lose Xiao Cao. It is difficult to restore fortune to Han Zuo, and he is determined to annihilate the army and work hard."
现实,杜甫,诸将五首,唐,汉朝陵墓对南山，胡虏千秋尚入关。昨日玉鱼蒙葬地，早时金盌出人间。见愁汗马西戎逼，曾闪朱旗北斗殷。多少材官守泾渭，将军且莫破愁颜。韩公本意筑三城，拟绝天骄拔汉旌。岂谓尽烦回纥马，翻然远救朔方兵。胡来不觉潼关隘，龙起犹闻晋水清。独使至尊忧社稷，诸君何以荅升平。洛阳宫殿化为烽，休道秦关百二重。沧海未全归禹贡，蓟门何处尽尧封。朝廷衮职虽多预，天下军储不自供。稍喜临边王相国，肯销金甲事春农。回首扶桑铜柱标，冥冥氛祲未全销。越裳翡翠无消息，南海明珠久寂寥。殊锡曾为大司马，总戎皆插侍中貂。炎风朔雪天王地，只在忠臣翊圣朝。锦江春色逐人来，巫峡清秋万壑哀。正忆往时严仆射，共迎中使望乡台。主恩前后三持节，军令分明数举杯。西蜀地形天下险，安危须仗出群材。,Reality,Du Fu,five generals,"The mausoleum of the Han Dynasty faces Nanshan, and Hulu still entered the pass for thousands of years. Yuyu was buried yesterday, and the golden bowl came out of the world early in the morning. Seeing the sorrowful sweat and Ma Xirong's pressure, Zeng flashed the Zhu flag to fight against Yin. How many officials guard Jingwei, generals don't break the sad face. Han Gong originally intended to build three cities, intending to pull out the banners of Han. Does it mean that you can go back to the Hema all the time and save Shuofang soldiers from afar? Hu Lai didn't realize Tong Pass, and Long Qi still heard Jin Shuiqing. If the supreme being alone worries about the country, how can the kings be peaceful. The palace of Luoyang was turned into a beacon, and the road to Qin Guan was doubled. The whole sea has not been returned to Yu Gong, where is the Jimen to be sealed by Yao. Although there are many appointments in the imperial court, the military reserves of the world cannot provide for themselves. A little happy Linbian Wang Xiangguo, willing to sell gold armor to do Chunnong. Looking back at the copper pillars of Fusang, it is not all sold out. There is no news about the emeralds in Yueshang, and the pearls of the South China Sea have been lonely for a long time. Shuxi used to be the great Sima, and all the generals served Zhong Diao. Yanfengshuo Snow Heavenly King Land is only in the loyal minister Yisheng Dynasty. The spring scenery of the Jinjiang River is coming one by one, and the Wu Gorge is mourning in the clear autumn. Just remembering the past, Yan Pu shot, and we welcomed the Chinese envoy Wangxiangtai together. Before and after the grace of the Lord, there are three holding festivals, and the military orders are clearly counted. The terrain of Western Shu is dangerous all over the world, and the safety and danger must rely on the best talents."
现实,杜甫,舍弟观赴蓝田取妻子到江陵喜寄三首,唐,汝迎妻子达荆州，消息真传解我忧。鸿雁影来连峡内，鹡鸰飞急到沙头。峣关险路今虚远，禹凿寒江正稳流。朱绂即当随彩鹢，青春不假报黄牛。马度秦关雪正深，北来肌骨苦寒侵。他乡就我生春色，故国移居见客心。剩欲提携如意舞，喜多行坐白头吟。巡檐索共梅花笑，冷蕊疏枝半不禁。庾信罗含俱有宅，春来秋去作谁家。短墙若在从残草，乔木如存可假花。卜筑应同蒋诩径，为园须似邵平瓜。比年病酒开涓滴，弟劝兄酬何怨嗟。,Reality,Du Fu,The brother-in-law went to Lantian to pick up his wife and sent three poems to Jiangling,"Ru welcomes his wife to Jingzhou, and the news is true to relieve my worries. The shadow of swan geese came to Lianxia, and the wagtail flew to Shatou in a hurry. The dangerous road at Gaoguan is far away now, and the cold river is flowing steadily by Yu Chiu. Zhu Fu should immediately follow the colorful bird, and his youth will not be falsely reported to the scalper. The snow is deep in Madu Qinguan, and the bitter cold invades the muscles and bones from the north. I live in spring in a foreign country, and I am a guest when I move to my hometown. If you want to support the wishful dance, Xi Duxing sits and sings with his white head. Patrolling the eaves, the plum blossoms laughed, and Leng Rui couldn't help thinning the branches. Yu Xin Luo Hanju has a house, and spring and autumn go to someone else's house. If the short wall grows from remnants of grass, the trees can be used as fake flowers. Bu Zhu should be the same as Jiang Xujing, and the garden must be like Shaoping melon. Years of sickness and wine dripping, why should I complain about my brother's persuasion."

If you want to go to the cloudy mountains and snow, if you don't go, you will have incense. Absolutely break through the clouds and open the splendor, loosen the water and play the reed. Seeing that Junyi is watching Wang Qiaolu, it is true that Shangfang is doubtful. When Mi plays the piano, Zairi, the army finally abandons Yingmiao. The integrity of the family is still alive, and the political style is here today. The poor guests are all overwhelmed, where is the old man to write poems. Wu Gorge on the Chu River is half cloudy and rainy, watching chess with clear mats and sparse curtains."

The king thought that the hairy bones were different.","Xue Feiyu stands in the clear autumn, and travels far away without hesitation. In the field, I only teach the mind to break through, and what to do with thousands of people. I know that I am invincible all my life, and I can be ashamed of being inferior in a hundred battles. The Peng hinders the nine heavens and must be avoided, and the rabbit hides in the three holes, so don't worry deeply. The black eagle is unconscious, and the sea is suspected to come from the North Pole. Zhenghe Tuanfeng Chaozisai, Lidong a few nights on the balcony. Yu Luo has his own ingenuity and ingenuity, and the spring geese will return together and guess. Thousands of miles of cold sky is only one day, golden eyes and jade claws are extraordinary."

The bamboos sing emeralds, and the sand dances with pheasants. The flower stamens are chaotic, and there are many bees and butterflies flying around. The secluded dwelling is lazy, and the guest wants to do what he wants. Drill wells to pay palm leaves, open canals to cut bamboo roots. The flat boat is light and the cable is light, and the path leads to the village. The rapid rain carries the foot of the stream, and the slanting light turns to the waist of the tree. The yellow birds in the nests merge together, and the algae and white fish jump. Let the bamboo shoots go through the wall, and the vines in the courtyard thorn the eaves. The sky is clear and the grass is slender. The river moves and the moon moves stones, and the stream is empty with clouds and flowers. Birds know the old way, who's home when the sail passes by."
现实,杜甫,复愁十二首,唐,人烟生处僻，虎迹过新蹄。野鹘翻窥草，村船逆上溪。钓艇收缗尽，昏鸦接翅归。月生初学扇，云细不成衣。万国尚防寇，故园今若何。昔归相识少，早已战场多。身觉省郎在，家须农事归。年深荒草径，老恐失柴扉。金丝镂箭镞，皂尾制旗竿。一自风尘起，犹嗟行路难。胡虏何曾盛，干戈不肯休。闾阎听小子，谈话觅封侯。贞观铜牙弩，开元锦兽张。花门小前好，此物弃沙场。今日翔麟马，先宜驾鼓车。无劳问河北，诸将觉荣华。任转江淮粟，休添苑囿兵。由来貔虎士，不满凤皇城。江上亦秋色，火云终不移。巫山犹锦树，南国且黄鹂。每恨陶彭泽，无钱对菊花。如今九日至，自觉酒须赊。病减诗仍拙，吟多意有馀。莫看江总老，犹被赏时鱼。,Reality,Du Fu,Twelve Poems of Resurrection,"People live in secluded places, and tigers have passed their new hoofs. Wild falcons look through the grass, and village boats go up the stream. The fishing boats are all reeled in, and the faint crow returns with its wings. The moon is a beginner who learns to fan, and the clouds are too thin to make clothes. All nations are still defending against bandits, what is the hometown like today? There are few acquaintances in the past, but there have been many battlefields. Feeling that Shenglang is here, the family must return to farming. In the depths of the wild grass path, I am always afraid of losing the firewood. Arrowheads carved with gold thread, and flagpoles made of soap tails. Once the wind and dust rise, it is still difficult to travel. When the Hulu were ever prosperous, they refused to give up fighting. Lu Yan listened to the boy, and talked to find the Marquis. Zhenguan Bronze Teeth Crossbow, Kaiyuan Brocade Beast Zhang. Huamen Xiaoqian is good, this thing is abandoned on the battlefield. Today, Xianglin horses should drive drum chariots first. If you don't bother to ask Hebei, the generals will feel prosperous. Ren transferred to Jianghuai millet, and Hugh added Yuanyuan soldiers. It's because Pihu warriors are dissatisfied with Fenghuang City. Autumn is also on the river, and the fire clouds will never move. Wushan still has brocade trees, and the southern country has orioles. Every time I hate Tao Pengze, I have no money against Chrysanthemum. Now that the 9th is here, I feel that I need credit for wine. Poems are still clumsy due to illness, and the poems are full of meaning. Don't look at Mr. Jiang, he is still rewarded with fish."

From now on, I know people's wishes, and I have to come back a hundred times a day. Countless spring bamboo shoots are growing in the forest, and the chaimen are densely blocking the pedestrians.

Today's people sneer at spreading Fu, and they don't realize that the former are afraid of the younger. Lu Luo, the king of Yang, was in style at that time, and his frivolity was still unremarkable. Ercao's body and name are all destroyed, and the rivers and rivers will not be abolished through the ages. Even if Lu Wang's calligraphy is inferior to that of the Han and Wei Dynasties. The dragon and the tiger's spine are controlled by the emperor, and everyone has seen Ercao in the past. Talent should be difficult to boast of a few men, who is the best of the pack today. Or look at the emerald orchids, the whales that have not been caught in the blue sea. People today love the ancients no less, and clear words and beautiful sentences must be neighbors. Stealing Qu Song Yifang's driving, fearing that he will follow in the footsteps of Qi Liang. If you are not as good as the former sages, there is no doubt about who was the first.

The plums are ripe and Xu eats with Zhu Lao, and Song Gao intends to talk about Ruan Sheng. I want to be a Yuliang cloud and return to turmoil, because I am frightened by the sound of rain in April. Qingxi first had the Jiaolong Grotto, and the bamboo and stones were like mountains and dare not rest. Two orioles sing green willows, and a group of egrets go up to the blue sky. The window contains the snow for thousands of years in Xiling, and the gate is anchored by a boat thousands of miles away in Dongwu.

Zhou Xuan is the king of Han Wujin, a filial son and loyal ministers, future generations will see. There are many songs on the noisy road, and all the generals of Hebei have entered the court. At first, it was the royal family of Qiankun, but it was lost to Jianghan guests. Don't tell me that you don't have a show, and you are at a loss and send people to guess. Support soldiers and learn from Ge Rui, and the envoys have worked a million times in vain. Mingyu Qiangjin is the official minister, and there is no one who cultivates culture and Yanwu. Xing Wang will be quiet and demon atmosphere, and the holy life should be over ten thousand springs. A hero sees things like a god, and a sage has a small heart. Yan Zhaoxiu produced beauties, and the palace did not plan to select talented people. Jiang Tianbai Shoulang is sick, and the spring is late in the empty mountain pavilions. The clothes and hats are the emperor of Japan, when will the grass play enter the emperor's hometown. Chanman, one hundred states in Shandong, is cut into green hills surrounded by eucalyptus. Baomao re-entered the customs, and Wang Ji also made offerings to the head of the sea. Beyond Liaoshui River in the east and Hutuo in the north, the astrological situation is happy and harmonious. Ziqiguan is close to the sky and the earth is wide, and there are many talented people in the golden platform. Yuyang suddenly rides in Handan, drunk with wine and with a golden whip hanging from his bridle. The spirit returns to Shuangquewu, and Xionghao repatriates Wulingzhi. General Li Xiang embraces Jimen, although his old head is old, his heart is still there. It is possible to talk about the princes, knowing that there has always been the emperor. Over the past twelve years on the battlefield, Tianwei has died down. The god is the master of Zhongxing in the Han Dynasty, and the king of Fenyang has a different surname for his achievements."

The North Pole turns to worry about the spirit of dragons and tigers, and Xirong rests his dogs and sheep. Zanpu taught many envoys to enter Qin Dynasty, and Shutong reconciled to stop the smoke and dust. The imperial court suddenly uses General Geshu to kill Princess Xupei. The west pole of Kongtong passes Kunlun, and camels and horses come to embrace the gate of the country. After several years of rebellion, the road was broken, and the Tibetans gradually ran away after hearing the news. Caiyu River in the west of Bolutian, Jiankun and Biwan are the most numerous. In the old days, the envoys of the Han Dynasty had thousands of piles of treasures, and the king of the Shaohu Hu had ten thousand piles of treasures. This spring is full of joy and joy, and the north, south, east, and west are supreme. In the second year of the Dali calendar, jade candles were adjusted, and Emperor Xuanyuan was the grandson of Yun."

现实,杜甫,大云寺赞公房四首,唐,心在水精域，衣沾春雨时。洞门尽徐步，深院果幽期。到扉开复闭，撞钟斋及兹。醍醐长发性，饮食过扶衰。把臂有多日，开怀无愧辞。黄鹂度结构，紫鸽下罘罳。愚意会所适，花边行自迟。汤休起我病，微笑索题诗。童儿汲井华，惯捷瓶上手。沾洒不濡地，埽除似无帚。明霞烂复阁，霁雾搴高牖。侧塞被径花，飘飖委墀柳。艰难世事迫，隐遁佳期后。晤语契深心，那能总钳口。奉辞还杖策，暂别终回首。泱泱泥污人，听听国多狗。既未免羁绊，时来憩奔走。近公如白雪，执热烦何有。,Reality,Du Fu,Four Poems of Zan Gongfang in Dayun Temple,"The heart is in the water essence, when the clothes are covered with spring rain. Walk slowly through the cave gate, and the deep courtyard is in a quiet period. When the door opens and closes again, hit the bell and fast. It's long-haired, and eating too much can help the decline. It's been a long time since I held my arm, and I resigned with no regrets. The structure of the oriole is the structure, and the purple pigeon is under the 罘罳. If you are stupid, you will be comfortable, and lace will be late. Tang Xiu woke up from my illness and asked for a poem with a smile. Tonger draws Jinghua, and is used to the bottle. The ground is not wetted, and it seems that there is no broom in addition to it. Mingxia died and returned to the pavilion, and the fog was high. The side plug is covered with flowers in the diameter, and the willows are floating in the air. The world is difficult and the world is pressing, after the good time is hidden. The language agreement is deep in the heart, and it can always be in the jaws. Resignation is also a policy, and I will look back for a while. A lot of muddy people, listen to the country and more dogs. Since it is not free from fetters, it is time to rest and run. My neighbor is like Bai Xue, why is it bothering me to be hot?"
现实,杜甫,大云寺赞公房四首 其二,唐,细软青丝履，光明白氎巾。深藏供老宿，取用及吾身。自顾转无趣，交情何尚新。道林才不世，惠远德过人。雨泻暮檐竹，风吹青井芹。天阴对图画，最觉润龙鳞。灯影照无睡，心清闻妙香。夜深殿突兀，风动金锒铛。天黑闭春院，地清栖暗芳。玉绳回断绝，铁凤森翱翔。梵放时出寺，钟残仍殷床。明朝在沃野，苦见尘沙黄。,Reality,Du Fu,The second of the four poems of Zan Gongfang in Dayun Temple,"Soft green silk shoes, bright and white scarves. Hidden deep for the old place, taking and using it and my body. Self care turns boring, friendship is still new. Daolin is immortal, but Huiyuande is extraordinary. Bamboo on the eaves of the evening rain, wind blowing Qingjing celery. Tianyin is most fond of pictures when it comes to moistening dragon scales. The shadow of the lamp shines without sleep, and the heart is clear and smells the wonderful fragrance. In the middle of the night, the hall is abrupt, and the wind moves the golden clang. It's dark and the spring courtyard is closed, and the ground is clear and the place is dark and fragrant. The jade rope was cut off, and Tie Fengsen soared. When the Vatican left the temple, Zhong Can was still in bed. The Ming Dynasty was in the fertile field, and it was hard to see the dust and sand yellow."
现实,杜甫,伤春五首,唐,天下兵虽满，春光日自浓。西京疲百战，北阙任群凶。关塞三千里，烟花一万重。蒙尘清路急，御宿且谁供。殷复前王道，周迁旧国容。蓬莱足云气，应合总从龙。莺入新年语，花开满故枝。天青风捲幔，草碧水通池。牢落官军速，萧条万事危。鬓毛元自白，泪点向来垂。不是无兄弟，其如有别离。巴山春色静，北望转逶迤。日月还相斗，星辰屡合围。不成诛执法，焉得变危机。大角缠兵气，钩陈出帝畿。烟尘昏御道，耆旧把天衣。行在诸军阙，来朝大将稀。贤多隐屠钓，王肯载同归。再有朝廷乱，难知消息真。近传王在洛，复道使归秦。夺马悲公主，登车泣贵嫔。萧关迷北上，沧海欲东巡。敢料安危体，犹多老大臣。岂无嵇绍血，沾洒属车尘。闻说初东幸，孤儿却走多。难分太仓粟，竞弃鲁阳戈。胡虏登前殿，王公出御河。得无中夜舞，谁忆大风歌。春色生烽燧，幽人泣薜萝。君臣重修德，犹足见时和。,Reality,Du Fu,Five poems about hurting spring,"Although the world is full of soldiers, the sun shines brightly in spring. Xijing is tired of many battles, and Beique is the leader of the gang. The gate is three thousand miles away, and the fireworks are ten thousand. The dust is in a hurry to clear the road, and who will pay for the royal residence. Yin restored the former kingly way, and Zhou moved to the old state. Penglai is full of clouds and spirits, and should be combined with the general to follow the dragon. The warbler enters the New Year's language, and the flowers are full of old branches. The sky is blue and the wind is rolling, and the grass and water are flowing into the pool. The prison is fast, and everything is in danger. The temples confessed, and the tears kept falling. It's not that there are no brothers, it's as if there is separation. Bashan is quiet in spring, looking north and winding. The sun and the moon are still fighting each other, and the stars are surrounded repeatedly. If the law cannot be punished, how can it become a crisis. The big horn wraps around the military spirit, hooks Chen out of the emperor's body. The smoke and dust fainted the royal road, and the elders put on the heavenly clothes. Walking in the gate of the army, there are few generals who come to the court. Xian Duo hides from slaughtering and fishing, and Wang Kenzai returns together. If there is further chaos in the court, it is difficult to know the truth of the news. According to recent legend, the king was in Luo, and the Taoist envoy returned to Qin. The princess is sad when she wins the horse, and she weeps for her concubine when she boards the car. Xiao Guan fans go north, and the sea wants to patrol east. Dare to predict safety and danger, Juduo old minister. How can there be no Ji Shao's blood, which is stained with car dust. I heard that Chudong was lucky, but many orphans left. It is difficult to distinguish Taicang millet, and Lu Yangge is abandoned. Hu Lu went to the front hall, and princes went out to Yuhe. There is no middle night dance, who will recall the song of the wind. In the spring, there are beacons, and you people weep. Monarchs and ministers re-cultivate virtue, which is enough to see the harmony of the times."
现实,杜甫,西阁二首,唐,巫山小摇落，碧色见松林。百鸟各相命，孤云无自心。层轩俯江壁，要路亦高深。朱绂犹纱帽，新诗近玉琴。功名不早立，衰病谢知音。哀世非王粲，终然学越吟。懒心似江水，日夜向沧洲。不道含香贱，其如镊白休。经过调碧柳，萧索倚朱楼。毕娶何时竟，消中得自由。豪华看古往，服食寄冥搜。诗尽人间兴，兼须入海求。,Reality,Du Fu,West Pavilion Two Poems,"Wushan falls slightly, and the pine forest is seen in blue color. A hundred birds have their own destiny, but a lonely cloud has no heart of its own. Layers of pavilions overlook the river wall, and the main road is also high and deep. Zhu Fu is like a gauze hat, and new poems are close to Yuqin. Fame is not established early, and disease is declining. It is not Wang Can who mourns the world, but he learns more and more singing in the end. The lazy heart is like the river, day and night to Cangzhou. It doesn't contain fragrance and lowliness, it's like tweezers. Passing through Tiaobiliu, Xiao Suo leans on Zhulou. After all, when to marry, you will be free in the elimination. Luxurious look at the past, take food and send it to search. Poetry is full of prosperity in the world, and it must go to the sea to seek it."

The sky wants to rain today, and the mountains return to eternal spring. The hero has more than his career, but he has been old for a long time. Get drunk with guests from other countries, and meet people from the motherland. Bing Ge still embraces Shu, Fu collects and loses to Qin. It's not that it's annoying to win, and it's deeply ashamed and afraid of hurting the spirit. Baidi's ancestral temple is empty, and lonely clouds come and go. The city of Jiangshan is turning around, and the guest of Dongyu is returning. Where is the bravery now, it was also strong back then. Later generations use wine and meat, and the empty palace is full of dust. The song of the valley birds has passed, and the forest flowers have fallen and bloomed again. How ashamed and weak, riding a horse into the moss."

First go to the regular banquet, the spectacle has been dusted. Feng Ji's birthday is written, and Longchi's moat is ashes. Xiangchuan has new tears, and Qin Shu is far away from the tower. The ministers of the precious mirror get it, and the Jinwu and all nations return. Qu Zun does not drink heavily, and mourns alone with his white head. The Yuqi Yunlou is open, and the wind and color are high. The fairy Zhang Neile, the queen mother presents the palace peach. Luo socks are red and colorful, and gold is white and snowy. The dance steps hold the longevity wine, and walk the rope to carry the autumn hair. The Holy Lord is old, and his heart is working hard today. The Guijiang River flows north, sending waves everywhere."

He is proud of embroidering feathers and holding flowers, but I have no chance for a beauty to ride a bamboo. It's hard for Hu Tong to end, and Chu Nu's waist is also pitiful. I don't see the old place of Dingwang City, but Jia Fujing of Changhuai is still there. Falsely touching Jiaoju as cold food, actually borrowing Yan Jun to sell divination money. All natures in the Zhongding mountain forest, thick rice with turbid mash is my year. This body wanders from east to west, and his right arm is withered and half deaf. The lonely tie boat both shed tears, lying on the left book empty leisurely. Ten years of cuju will lead young children far away, and the customs of thousands of miles of swing are the same. The geese go up to the clouds and return to Zisai, and the family members use the green maple for drilling fire. In the fireworks in the pavilions of Qincheng, in the beautiful mountains and rivers of the Han Dynasty. When Fengshui spring comes, the Dongting is wide, and Bai Ping is worried about killing the pulsatilla."

The leaves are full of green feathers, and countless golden coins are blooming. The cool wind is rustling and you are in a hurry, fearing that you will be hard to be independent in the future. The scholar in the hall has a blank head, smelling the fragrance three times in the wind and weeping. The wind is long, the rain is long, and the autumn is one after another. The four seas and the eight deserts are the same cloud. Going to Malay cattle is no longer distinguishable, what is the difference between turbid Jing and Qing Wei. The head of the grain grows ears and the ears of millet are black, and there is no news of the farmers and field wives. In the city, a bucket of rice is exchanged for a quilt, and Xu Ning talks about the straightness of the two. Chang'an civilians will count, and the door will be locked and blocked by guards. The old man does not grow basil, and the young child has no worries about the wind and rain. The whistling rain urges the early cold, and the Hu Yan's wings are wet and it is difficult to fly high. Autumn has never seen the day, when will the soil dry after the mud."

The wanderer is empty and drooping two hairs, and the white stone and plain sand are also swinging, and the mourner is alone begging for his Cao. Even if the matter is neither today nor ancient, the long song is so exciting that it touches the forest. It is hard to count more luxurious houses than houses, and our hearts are ashamed, why are brothers and nephews so sad that tears are like rain. Don't ask the sky in this life, Du Qu is lucky to have Sang Matian. Therefore, he will move to the edge of Nanshan Mountain, and he will follow Li Guang with short clothes and horses, and watch the tigers die when they shoot."
现实,杜甫,羌村,唐,峥嵘赤云西，日脚下平地。柴门鸟雀噪，归客千里至。妻孥怪我在，惊定还拭泪。世乱遭飘荡，生还偶然遂。邻人满墙头，感叹亦歔欷。夜阑更秉烛，相对如梦寐。晚岁迫偷生，还家少欢趣。娇儿不离膝，畏我复却去。忆昔好追凉，故绕池边树。萧萧北风劲，抚事煎百虑。赖知禾黍收，已觉糟床注。如今足斟酌，且用慰迟暮。群鸡正乱叫，客至鸡斗争。驱鸡上树木，始闻叩柴荆。父老四五人，问我久远行。手中各有携，倾榼浊复清。苦辞酒味薄，黍地无人耕。兵革既未息，儿童尽东征。请为父老歌，艰难愧深情。歌罢仰天叹，四座泪纵横。,Reality,Du Fu,Qiang Village,"The towering Chiyun West, the sun is flat on the ground. The birds in Caimen are noisy, and the returning guests come thousands of miles away. My wife and children blamed me for being there, and they wiped their tears in shock. The chaos of the world is drifting, and the survival is accidental. The neighbors are all over the wall, sighing and sighing. Yelan is more candle-lit, relatively like a dream. In his later years, he was forced to steal a life, and he was happy with his family. Jiaoer stays on her knees, fearing that I will come back. Reminiscing about the past, I was fond of chasing the coolness, so I circled the trees by the pool. Xiao Xiao, the north wind is strong, and the caress is full of worries. Lai Zhihe harvested the millet, and felt bad for the bed note. It is enough to consider now, and to comfort the old age. The flock of chickens is screaming, and the guests come to the chickens to fight. After driving the chickens up the trees, I heard the sound of knocking on the firewood. Four or five elders asked me about my long journey. Each has a hand in his hand, pouring out the turbidity and clearing it up. The taste of bitter wine is weak, and the millet land is uncultivated. The military revolution has not stopped, and the children have all marched eastward. Please sing for your father, be ashamed of hardships and affectionate. After singing, he looked up to the sky and sighed, and the four seats burst into tears."
现实,杜甫,遣兴三首,唐,下马古战场，四顾但茫然。风悲浮云去，黄叶坠我前。朽骨穴蝼蚁，又为蔓草缠。故老行叹息，今人尚开边。汉虏互胜负，封疆不常全。安得廉耻将，三军同晏眠。高秋登塞山，南望马邑州。降虏东击胡，壮健尽不留。穹庐莽牢落，上有行云愁。老弱哭道路，愿闻甲兵休。邺中事反覆，死人积如丘。诸将已茅土，载驱谁与谋。丰年孰云迟，甘泽不在早。耕田秋雨足，禾黍已映道。春苗九月交，颜色同日老。劝汝衡门士，忽悲尚枯槁。时来展材力，先后无丑好。但讶鹿皮翁，忘机对芳草。,Reality,Du Fu,three poems,"Dismounting from the ancient battlefield, I looked around but was at a loss. The wind is sad and the clouds are gone, and the yellow leaves fall in front of me. The ants in the rotting bone cave are also entangled in weeds. Therefore, the old man sighed, but today's people are still open. The Han and captives won and lost each other, and the borders were not always complete. Ande is a shameless general, and the three armies sleep with Yan. Gaoqiu climbs Saishan Mountain, looking south at Mayi Prefecture. Send the captives to the east and attack the Hu, leaving no strength behind. The Qionglu is mang and prison, and there are clouds of sorrow on it. The old and the weak cry for the road, wishing to hear that the soldiers will rest. Things in Yezhong are repeated, and the dead are piled up like hills. The generals are already in the grass, who will be driven and who will be conspired. Is it too late for a good year, but Gan Ze is not too early. The plowing field is full of autumn rain, and the millet has been reflected. The spring seedlings are handed in in September, and the color will age on the same day. Advise Ruheng disciples, suddenly sad and withered. Time to show material strength, has no ugly good. But amazed by Lupi Weng, he forgot to face Fangcao."
现实,杜甫,西枝村寻置草堂地夜宿赞公土室二首,唐,出郭眄细岑，披榛得微路。溪行一流水，曲折方屡渡。赞公汤休徒，好静心迹素。昨枉霞上作，盛论岩中趣。怡然共携手，恣意同远步。扪萝涩先登，陟巘眩反顾。要求阳冈暖，苦陟阴岭冱。惆怅老大藤，沈吟屈蟠树。卜居意未展，杖策回且暮。层巅馀落日，早蔓已多露。天寒鸟已归，月出人更静。土室延白光，松门耿疏影。跻攀倦日短，语乐寄夜永。明燃林中薪，暗汲石底井。大师京国旧，德业天机秉。从来支许游，兴趣江湖迥。数奇谪关塞，道广存箕颍。何知戎马间，复接尘事屏。幽寻岂一路，远色有诸岭。晨光稍曚昽，更越西南顶。,Reality,Du Fu,Xizhi Village is looking for a thatched cottage to stay overnight in Zan Gong's Tushi two poems,"Go out of Guo Yu Xicen, and wear hazel to get a small road. The stream is a first-rate stream, with twists and turns and repeated crossings. Zan Gong Tang Xiutu, so calm and simple. Yesterday, vain xia made it up, and talked about the interest in the rock. Let's join hands together happily and walk far away together. Touch the radish first, and go back to the dizzy. Yanggang is required to be warm, but Yinling is bitter. The melancholy old vine, pondering Qu Panshu. Bu Juyi has not developed, and the staff is back and it is dusk. The sun is setting on the top of the layer, and the early vines are already exposed. The weather is cold and the bird has returned, and the moon rises and people are quieter. The earth room extends the white light, and the pine door Geng Shuying. The days of climbing are short, and the language and music are sent to the night forever. Burning the salary in the forest, and drawing the stone bottom well in the dark. Master Jingguo is old, and his virtues and careers are full of secrets. I have never supported Xu You, and my interests range from rivers and lakes. A few odd banished to Guansai, Daoguang kept Jiying. How do you know that between soldiers and horses, the dust screen will be reconnected. Is there any way to search for you, there are mountains in the distance. The morning light is a little bit late, and it is getting more and more southwest."
现实,杜甫,梦李白二首,唐,死别已吞声，生别常恻恻。江南瘴疠地，逐客无消息。故人入我梦，明我长相忆。恐非平生魂，路远不可测。魂来枫叶青，魂返关塞黑。君今在罗网，何以有羽翼。落月满屋梁，犹疑照颜色。水深波浪阔，无使蛟龙得。浮云终日行，游子久不至。三夜频梦君，情亲见君意。告归常局促，苦道来不易。江湖多风波，舟楫恐失坠。出门搔白首，若负平生志。冠盖满京华，斯人独憔悴。孰云网恢恢，将老身反累。千秋万岁名，寂莫身后事。,Reality,Du Fu,Dream Li Bai Two Poems,"Farewell to death has been swallowed, life is often sad. In the pestilent land in the south of the Yangtze River, there is no news of chasing guests. The old man enters my dream, making me remember each other. I'm afraid it's not a lifelong soul, and the road is far and unpredictable. The soul comes to Maple Leaf Green, and the soul returns to Guansai Hei. You are in the net now, why do you have wings? The falling moon is all over the beams of the house, hesitating to illuminate the color. The water is deep and the waves are wide, and there is no way for the dragon to get it. Floating clouds travel all day long, but wanderers never arrive. Three nights of frequent dreams of the king, and the love of the king sees the king's will. It is often cramped to report back, and the bitter road is not easy. There are many turmoil in the rivers and lakes, and the boats are afraid of falling. Scratching the white head when you go out is like losing your life ambitions. The crown is full of Jinghua, and the Sri Lankan is alone and haggard. When the cloud and network are restored, the old body will be tired. Qianqiu long live name, lonely nothing behind."
现实,杜甫,遣兴五首,唐,蛰龙三冬卧，老鹤万里心。昔时贤俊人，未遇犹视今。嵇康不得死，孔明有知音。又如垄底松，用舍在所寻。大哉霜雪干，岁久为枯林。昔者庞德公，未曾入州府。襄阳耆旧间，处士节独苦。岂无济时策，终竟畏罗罟。林茂鸟有归，水深鱼知聚。举家依鹿门，刘表焉得取。陶潜避俗翁，未必能达道。观其著诗集，颇亦恨枯槁。达生岂是足，默识盖不早。有子贤与愚，何其挂怀抱。贺公雅吴语，在位常清狂。上疏乞骸骨，黄冠归故乡。爽气不可致，斯人今则亡。山阴一茅宇，江海日凄凉。吾怜孟浩然，裋褐即长夜。赋诗何必多，往往凌鲍谢。清江空旧鱼，春雨馀甘蔗。每望东南云，令人几悲吒。,Reality,Du Fu,Send Xing five poems,"The stinging dragon lies three times in winter, and the old crane has thousands of miles of heart. The virtuous and handsome people in the past, they still look at the present if they haven't met. Ji Kang must not die, Kong Ming has a bosom friend. It is also like a pine at the bottom of a ridge, where you can find what you want. The great frost and snow are dry, and the long years are dry forests. In the past, Duke Pang De never entered the state capital. In the old age of Xiangyang, the festival of being a scholar is lonely. Is there no way to help the time, and I am afraid of Luo Kui in the end. Lin Mao birds have home, deep water fish know how to gather. The whole family depends on Lumen, how can Liu Biao get it. Tao Qian avoids vulgarity, and may not be able to achieve the Tao. Looking at his collection of poems, he also hates being withered. Dasheng is not enough, tacit knowledge cover is not early. There are sons who are virtuous and foolish, how can they hang in their arms. He Gongya's Wu language is always insane in his reign. Go up and beg for bones, Huang Guan returns to his hometown. If you can't be refreshed, the Sri Lankan will die today. There is a Maoyu in the shade of the mountain, and the river and the sea are desolate day by day. I feel pity for Meng Haoran, the brown coat is the long night. Why so many poems, often Ling Baoxie. The Qingjiang River is empty of old fish, and the remaining sugar cane is left in the spring rain. Every time I look at the clouds in the southeast, I feel a little sad."
现实,杜甫,遣兴五首,唐,朔风飘胡雁，惨澹带砂砾。长林何萧萧，秋草萋更碧。北里富熏天，高楼夜吹笛。焉知南邻客，九月犹絺绤。长陵锐头儿，出猎待明发。骍弓金爪镝，白马蹴微雪。未知所驰逐，但见暮光灭。归来悬两狼，门户有旌节。漆有用而割，膏以明自煎。兰摧白露下，桂折秋风前。府中罗旧尹，沙道尚依然。赫赫萧京兆，今为时所怜。猛虎凭其威，往往遭急缚。雷吼徒咆哮，枝撑已在脚。忽看皮寝处，无复睛闪烁。人有甚于斯，足以劝元恶。朝逢富家葬，前后皆辉光。共指亲戚大，缌麻百夫行。送者各有死，不须羡其强。君看束练去，亦得归山冈。,Reality,Du Fu,Send Xing five poems,"Hu Yan floats in the new wind, gloomy with gravel. The long forest is He Xiaoxiao, and the autumn grass is greener and greener. The north is rich and smoked, and the tall buildings play the flute at night. How can I know that the neighbors in the south are still in September. The leader of Changling Rui, he is out hunting and waiting to be discovered. The red bow and the golden claws are dysprosium, and the white horse is lightly snowed. I don't know where to go, but I see the twilight disappearing. There are two wolves hanging on the return, and there are festivals at the door. The lacquer is used to cut it, and the paste is fried to make it clear. Lan destroys the white dew, and the osmanthus falls before the autumn wind. Luo Jiuyin in the mansion, Sha Dao is still there. Hehe, Xiao Jingzhao, is pitied by the times. Because of its power, fierce tigers are often bound in a hurry. Lei Houtu roared, the branches were already on his feet. Suddenly looking at the sleeping place, Wufu's eyes flickered. People have more than this, enough to persuade people to be evil. When the rich family is buried in the morning, the front and back are all glowing. A total of refers to relatives, and hundreds of husbands line up. The sender has his own death, so don't envy his strength. You see, if you go to Shulian, you have to return to the hill."

Picking up acorns and chestnuts at the age of the year, I followed the sniper, and it was cold and the sun was setting in the valley. There is no book in the Central Plains, and I can't return it. My hands and feet are frozen and my flesh is dead. Woohoo, a song, the song is already sad, and the sad wind comes from the sky for me. Long 镵 long 镵 white wood handle, I have a child to support my life. Huang Jing has no seedlings, and the mountain is full of snow, and the number of short clothes can't cover the shin. At this time, returning with Zikong, men moan and women groan, the walls are quiet. Woohoo two songs come to play, the neighbors are melancholy for me. There are younger brothers and there are younger brothers in the distance, each of the three is thin and who is stronger. Farewell to each other, Hu Chen has a long way to go. Flying geese in the east and geese in the rear, An De sent me to your side. Huh, three songs, three songs, where will you go to collect your brother's bones. There are younger sisters and younger sisters who are in Zhongli, and the lover died early, all lonely and foolish. Changhuai waves are high and dragons are angry. I haven't seen them for ten years. The flat boat is full of arrows, and there are many flags in the southern country. Woohoo four songs, four songs, four songs, Lin Yuan sings for me in the clear day. The four mountains are windy and the streams are rushing, the cold rain is rustling and the withered trees are wet. In the ancient city of Artemisia annua, the clouds do not open, and the white fox jumps on the beam and the yellow fox stands. Why am I born in a poor valley, sitting up in the middle of the night with all kinds of feelings. Wuhu Wuge Xige is growing, the soul cannot be summoned to return to the hometown. In the south, there is Longxi in the hills, and the ancient trees and branches are intertwined. The leaves are yellow and the dragon is stinging, and the viper comes from the east to the upper reaches of the water. I blame this An for daring to come out, drawing his sword to cut and rest. Woohoo Six Songs Come Songs Thinking Late, Streams and gullies rejuvenate me. The man is not famous at birth, he is already old, and he walked the barren mountain road after three years of hunger. How many years has Chang'an Qing been acquainted, wealth and honor should be born early. The Confucian scholars in the mountains are old acquaintances, but the words of the old past hurt my arms. Woo hoo seven songs come quietly finale, look up at the emperor's day and the speed of the day."
现实,杜甫,戏赠友二首,唐,元年建巳月，郎有焦校书。自誇足膂力，能骑生马驹。一朝被马踏，唇裂版齿无。壮心不肯已，欲得东擒胡。元年建巳月，官有王司直。马惊折左臂，骨折面如墨。驽骀漫深泥，何不避雨色。劝君休叹恨，未必不为福。,Reality,Du Fu,Two Songs for Friends,"In the Jiansi month of the first year, Lang Youjiao wrote the book. He boasted that he was strong enough to ride a raw horse. Once trampled by a horse, the lips are cleft and the teeth are gone. The strong heart refuses, and wants to win the east and capture the tiger. In the Jiansi month of the first year, Wang Sizhi was the official. The horse broke his left arm in shock, and the fracture surface was like ink. The mud is full of mud, why not avoid the rain. It is not necessarily a blessing to persuade you to stop sighing and hating."
现实,杜甫,述古三首,唐,赤骥顿长缨，非无万里姿。悲鸣泪至地，为问驭者谁。凤凰从东来，何意复高飞。竹花不结实，念子忍朝饥。古时君臣合，可以物理推。贤人识定分，进退固其宜。市人日中集，于利竞锥刀。置膏烈火上，哀哀自煎熬。农人望岁稔，相率除蓬蒿。所务谷为本，邪赢无乃劳。舜举十六相，身尊道何高。秦时任商鞅，法令如牛毛。汉光得天下，祚永固有开。岂惟高祖圣，功自萧曹来。经纶中兴业，何代无长才。吾慕寇邓勋，济时信良哉。耿贾亦宗臣，羽翼共裴回。休运终四百，图画在云台。,Reality,Du Fu,three ancient poems,"Chi Ji Dun long tassel, not without thousands of miles of appearance. Crying and crying to the ground, in order to ask who is the driver. The phoenix comes from the east, why do you want to fly high again? The bamboo flowers are not fruitful, and Nianzi endures the hunger. In ancient times, the combination of the monarch and his ministers can be deduced physically. A sage knows the points, and advances and retreats are solid. The people of the city gather every day to compete with the knife in Lili. Put it on the ointment fire, mourning and suffering. Farmers look forward to Sui Nen, and the rate is to remove basil. The valley is the foundation of all affairs, and there is nothing to do when evil wins. How high is Shun's dignity and morality when he holds up sixteen phases. Qin was in charge of Shang Yang at that time, and his laws and regulations were like a cow's hair. Han Guang wins the world, and Zuo Yong is inherently open. How can it be that the great ancestor sage, the merit comes from Xiao Cao. There is no long-term talent in any generation of Jinglun Zhongxingye. I admire Kou Dengxun, and I believe in good times. Geng Jia is also a minister of the Zongchen, and he shares his wings with Pei Hui. At the end of four hundred days, the picture is on the cloud platform."
现实,杜甫,忆昔二首,唐,忆昔先皇巡朔方，千乘万骑入咸阳。阴山骄子汗血马，长驱东胡胡走藏。邺城反覆不足怪，关中小儿坏纪纲，张后不乐上为忙。至今今上犹拨乱，劳身焦思补四方。我昔近侍叨奉引，出兵整肃不可当。为留猛士守未央，致使岐雍防西羌。犬戎直来坐御床，百官跣足随天王。愿见北地傅介子，老儒不用尚书郎。忆昔开元全盛日，小邑犹藏万家室。稻米流脂粟米白，公私仓廪俱丰实。九州道路无豺虎，远行不劳吉日出。齐纨鲁缟车班班，男耕女桑不相失。宫中圣人奏云门，天下朋友皆胶漆。百馀年间未灾变，叔孙礼乐萧何律。岂闻一绢直万钱，有田种谷今流血。洛阳宫殿烧焚尽，宗庙新除狐兔穴。伤心不忍问耆旧，复恐初从乱离说。小臣鲁钝无所能，朝廷记识蒙禄秩。周宣中兴望我皇，洒血江汉身衰疾。,Reality,Du Fu,Recalling the Past Two Songs,"Recalling that the former emperor visited Shuofang and rode thousands of horses into Xianyang. The proud son of the Yin Mountain, a bloody horse, drove east and west to hide. It's not surprising that Yecheng repeated itself. The children in Guanzhong were bad at Ji Gang, and Empress Zhang was not happy to be busy. Up to now, it is still chaotic, and it is hard to make up for the Quartet. In the past, I used to be a servant and a servant, and it was unacceptable to send troops to clean up. In order to keep the warriors guarding Weiyang, Qiyong defended against Xiqiang. Quan Rong came straight to sit on the imperial bed, and all the officials followed the king with their feet. I would like to see Fu Jiezi in the north, and the old Confucian does not need Shang Shulang. Recalling the heyday of Kaiyuan in the past, there are still thousands of houses in Xiaoyi. The rice is fat and the corn is white, and the public and private warehouses are full of fruit. There are no jackals and tigers on the roads of Kyushu, and the sunrise will not be auspicious when traveling far. Qiwan, Luxuan, and the trains are in frequent shifts, and men and women who farm and mulberry do not lose each other. The sages in the palace played Cloud Gate, and friends all over the world were glued to each other. There has been no catastrophe for more than a hundred years, and the rituals and music of uncles and grandchildren are Xiao Helu. Unexpectedly, a piece of silk is worth tens of thousands of dollars, and there are fields and valleys that are bleeding now. The Luoyang palace was burned to the ground, and the ancestral temple was newly removed from the fox and rabbit dens. I am so sad that I can't bear to ask the elders, and I am afraid that I will talk about the chaos at the beginning. The little minister is dull and incompetent, and the imperial court remembers Meng Luzhi. Zhou Xuanzhong hoped for my emperor, and Jiang Han was debilitated and ill."

Humiliated horses and horses are burnt, and trapped fish have spirits. Jun sees that he is an upright scholar, and he is not willing to change his body. Dangling tens of thousands of dendrobium boats, the shadow is like a white rainbow. When you lift up the mast, you must tap the ox, and hang the mat to gather all the merits. Since it is not the wind that moves the sky, don't put it in the big water. Martyrs are evil in many ways, and villains are self-same. Fame and wealth are desirable, but killing oneself is next to the powerful. He is an official Cao Qing, you can smile."

Pieces of clouds on the water, rain in Xiao Xiaosha. It is a nest dwelling in a special shape, and Zengtai overlooks Fengzhu. Jiake is suitable for thousands of miles, and the contemplation is delayed. The sails are far away, and the waves are full of Wu Chu. Jiuyin Jiaochi came out, and the bandits recovered a little. It is cloudy at night in the empty mountain, and it is slightly cold to pillow the mat first. The return wind blows from Qingshu, Vientiane is already green. Falling out of Xiuyun, leaning against the sky and rocks. What is the way to go on holidays, the rain contains the Yangtze River and white. There are Shihe spears and halberds on the Jingzhou boat with masts. The town of Nanfangcao was miserable, and he went to the long-distance service when he was wet.

The elders of the barbarians complained about the bitter cold, and the Kunlun Tianguan was frozen. Xuanyuan kept silent and couldn't whistle, and the white swan's wings drooped and his eyes were bleeding. Andechun used mud to mend the cracks in the ground. I came to Jiangmen late and lost a big tree, and the white house was blown by the strong wind at night. The heavenly soldiers cut off the Qinghai Rong, and moved south to the axis of the earth with a murderous spirit. It's so cool not to mention the bitter cold. Ling Li was born in the gorge of Padang, and the people who returned to Xuan in the blue sky learned about it."
现实,杜甫,咏怀二首,唐,人生贵是男，丈夫重天机。未达善一身，得志行所为。嗟余竟轗轲，将老逢艰危。胡雏逼神器，逆节同所归。河雒化为血，公侯草间啼。西京复陷没，翠盖蒙尘飞。万姓悲赤子，两宫弃紫微。倏忽向二纪，奸雄多是非。本朝再树立，未及贞观时。日给在军储，上官督有司。高贤迫形势，岂暇相扶持。疲苶苟怀策，栖屑无所施。先王实罪己，愁痛正为兹。岁月不我与，蹉跎病于斯。夜看丰城气，回首蛟龙池。齿发已自料，意深陈苦词。邦危坏法则，圣远益愁慕。飘飖桂水游，怅望苍梧暮。潜鱼不衔钩，走鹿无反顾。皦皦幽旷心，拳拳异平素。衣食相拘阂，朋知限流寓。风涛上春沙，千里侵江树。逆行少吉日，时节空复度。井灶任尘埃，舟航烦数具。牵缠加老病，琐细隘俗务。万古一死生，胡为足名数。多忧污桃源，拙计泥铜柱。未辞炎瘴毒，摆落跋涉惧。虎狼窥中原，焉得所历住。葛洪及许靖，避世常此路。贤愚诚等差，自爱各驰骛。羸瘠且如何，魄夺针灸屡。拥滞僮仆慵，稽留篙师怒。终当挂帆席，天意难告诉。南为祝融客，勉强亲杖屦。结托老人星，罗浮展衰步。,Reality,Du Fu,Two Songs of Yonghuai,"The most expensive thing in life is a man, and the husband is very secretive. If you don't have a good body, you will do what you want. I am so sad that I will be old and in danger. Hu Chu's magical weapon, the same as the rebellion. He Luo turned into blood, and Duke Cao cried. Xijing fell again, and Cui Gai was covered with dust. The surname of Wan is Bei Chizi, and Ziwei is abandoned by the two palaces. Suddenly to Erji, there are many right and wrong villains. This dynasty was established again, but it was not as long as Zhenguan. The daily supply is in the military reserve, and the Shangguan supervises and has divisions. Gao Xian is in a difficult situation, so he has no time to support him. Tired and struggling with strategies, there is nothing to do with living debris. The former king really sinned against himself, and his sorrow is hereby. The years are not with me, and the time is wasted and sick. Look at the atmosphere of Fengcheng at night, and look back at Jiaolongchi. The tooth hair has already been expected, and the bitter words are deeply meaningful. The state is in danger and the laws are broken, and Shengyuan is more and more envious. Floating in the osmanthus and swimming in the water, looking at the evening of Cangwu. Diving fish without hook, walking deer without turning back. The heart is quiet and open, and the fist is different from usual. Food and clothing are constrained, and friends and friends are limited. The wind and waves go up the spring sand and invade the trees of the river for thousands of miles. Retrograde less auspicious days, time and space are repeated. The well stove is full of dust, and the boat and boat are troubled by several. Entanglement adds to old age and sickness, trivial and narrow mundane affairs. For thousands of years, Hu is the number one. Worry about the pollution of the Taoyuan, and the humble plan of the mud and copper pillars. The poison of inflammation and miasma has not been dismissed, and the fear of trekking has been shaken off. Tigers and wolves peek at the Central Plains, how can they get what they live. Ge Hong and Xu Jing escaped the world and often traveled this way. The virtuous, the foolish, and the sincere are equally poor, and each loves his own. Lean barren and how, soul wins acupuncture and moxibustion repeatedly. The servants of the children are lazy, and the masters are angry when they stay behind. In the end, when the sail is hung, God's will is hard to tell. The south is a guest of Zhu Rong, and he barely kisses the staff. With the support of Canopus, Luofu will show its decline."
现实,杜甫,春水生二绝,唐,二月六夜春水生，门前小滩浑欲平。鸬鹚鸂鶒莫漫喜，吾与汝曹俱眼明。一夜水高二尺强，数日不可更禁当。南市津头有船卖，无钱即买系篱旁。,Reality,Du Fu,spring water life two unique,"On the night of February 6th, spring water is born, and the small beach in front of the door is muddy. Mo Manxi cormorants, Ru Cao and I both have eyesight. The water is two feet high in one night, and it can't be changed for a few days. There are boats for sale in Jintou, Nanshi. If you have no money, you can buy them by the fence."
现实,杜甫,绝句漫兴九首,唐,眼见客愁愁不醒，无赖春色到江亭。即遣花开深造次，便觉莺语太丁宁。手种桃李非无主，野老墙低还似家。恰似春风相欺得，夜来吹折数枝花。熟知茅斋绝低小，江上燕子故来频。衔泥点污琴书内，更接飞虫打著人。二月已破三月来，渐老逢春能几回。莫思身外无穷事，且尽生前有限杯。肠断春江欲尽头，杖藜徐步立芳洲。颠狂柳絮随风去，轻薄桃花逐水流。懒慢无堪不出村，呼儿日在掩柴门。苍苔浊酒林中静，碧水春风野外昏。糁径杨花铺白毡，点溪荷叶叠青钱。笋根稚子无人见，沙上凫雏傍母眠。舍西柔桑叶可拈，江畔细麦复纤纤。人生几何春已夏，不放香醪如蜜甜。隔户杨柳弱袅袅，恰似十五女儿腰。谁谓朝来不作意，狂风挽断最长条。,Reality,Du Fu,Nine Quatrains,"Seeing that the guests are worried and can't wake up, the rascal comes to Jiangting in spring. That is to say, after sending flowers to bloom for further studies, I feel that Yingyu is too Dingning. The hand-planted peaches and plums are not homeless, and the wild old walls are low but still like home. Just like the spring breeze bullying each other, blowing off several branches of flowers at night. Familiar with Mao Zhai is extremely low and small, so the swallows on the river come here frequently. The mud is stained in the piano book, and the flying insects are hitting people. February has broken and March has come, how many times can I get old and come back to spring. There are infinite things outside Mosi's body, and there are limited cups in his life. The heart is broken and the Spring River is about to end, and Zhang Chen slowly steps up Fangzhou. The wild catkins go with the wind, and the frivolous peach blossoms flow with the water. Too lazy to leave the village, Hu'er is covering the firewood gate every day. The moss is turbid and the wine is quiet in the forest, and the clear water and spring breeze are faint in the field. Pave white felt with poplar flowers in the grits path, and stack green coins with lotus leaves in Dianxi. Bamboo shoots and young children are not seen, and puppies sleep next to their mothers on the sand. The soft mulberry leaves in Shexi can be picked, and the fine wheat by the riverside is slender. How many times in life is spring and summer, and the fragrant mash is as sweet as honey. The willows next door are weak and curly, just like the waist of a fifteen-year-old daughter. Who says you don't pay attention to the coming, the strong wind breaks the longest strip."
现实,杜甫,江畔独步寻花七绝句,唐,江上被花恼不彻，无处告诉只颠狂。走觅南邻爱酒伴，经旬出饮独空床。稠花乱蕊畏江滨，行步欹危实怕春。诗酒尚堪驱使在，未须料理白头人。江深竹静两三家，多事红花映白花。报答春光知有处，应须美酒送生涯。东望少城花满烟，百花高楼更可怜。谁能载酒开金盏，唤取佳人舞绣筵。黄师塔前江水东，春光懒困倚微风。桃花一簇开无主，可爱深红爱浅红。黄四娘家花满蹊，千朵万朵压枝低。留连戏蝶时时舞，自在娇莺恰恰啼。不是爱花即肯死，只恐花尽老相催。繁枝容易纷纷落，嫩叶商量细细开。,Reality,Du Fu,Seven Quatrains of Looking for Flowers Alone by the River,"Jiangshang was so annoyed by the flowers that he had nowhere to tell but went mad. Walking to find the neighbors in the south who love wine, drink alone in the empty bed after ten days. Thick flowers and scattered pistils are afraid of the riverside, and they are afraid of the spring when they walk and walk. Poetry and wine can still be driven, and there is no need to take care of the white-headed people. There are two or three families in Jiangshen and Zhujing, and the troublesome red flowers reflect the white flowers. There is something to repay the spring, and you should have good wine to send you life. Looking to the east, Shaocheng is full of flowers and smoke, and the tall buildings with hundreds of flowers are even more pitiful. Who can open the golden cup with wine and call the beauties to dance and embroider the feast. In front of the Huangshi Pagoda, the river is east, and the spring is lazy and leaning on the breeze. A cluster of peach blossoms has no owner, lovely deep red loves light red. Huang Siniang's house is full of flowers, and thousands of flowers are pressed down on the branches. The lingering butterfly dances from time to time, and the free-spirited warbler sings. It's not that if you love flowers, you are willing to die. I'm afraid that the flowers will grow old. The branches are easy to fall one after another, and the young leaves bloom carefully."
现实,杜甫,屏迹三首,唐,用拙存吾道，幽居近物情。桑麻深雨露，燕雀半生成。村鼓时时急，渔舟个个轻。杖藜从白首，心迹喜双清。晚起家何事，无营地转幽。竹光团野色，舍影漾江流。失学从儿懒，长贫任妇愁。百年浑得醉，一月不梳头。衰颜甘屏迹，幽事供高卧。鸟下竹根行，龟开萍叶过。年荒酒价乏，日并园蔬课。犹酌甘泉歌，歌长击樽破。,Reality,Du Fu,three screen traces,"Use my clumsiness to keep my way, and live in a secluded place close to things. Sangma is deep in rain and dew, and chicks are half born. The village drum is always in a hurry, and the fishing boats are all light. Chenopodium sticks from the white head, and the heart is happy and clear. What's the matter with getting up late, there is no camp to turn to seclusion. The wild colors of the bamboo light clusters, the shadows of the houses ripple the river. If you can't go to school, you will be lazy, and if you are poor, you will worry about your wife. For a hundred years, I was so drunk that I didn't comb my hair for a month. Fading face and sweet screen traces, quiet things for high lying. The bird walks under the bamboo root, and the tortoise flies over the leaves. In the year of shortage, the price of wine is low, and the garden and vegetable classes are merged in the day. Still drinking the song of sweet spring, the song is long and the bottle is broken."
现实,杜甫,将赴成都草堂途中有作先寄严郑公五首,唐,得归茅屋赴成都，直为文翁再剖符。但使闾阎还揖让，敢论松竹久荒芜。鱼知丙穴由来美，酒忆郫筒不用酤。五马旧曾谙小径，几回书札待潜夫。处处青江带白蘋，故园犹得见残春。雪山斥候无兵马，锦里逢迎有主人。休怪儿童延俗客，不教鹅鸭恼比邻。习池未觉风流尽，况复旌州赏更新。竹寒沙碧浣花溪，菱刺藤梢咫尺迷。过客径须愁出入，居人不自解东西。书签药裹封蛛网，野店山桥送马蹄。岂藉荒庭春草色，先判一饮醉如泥。常苦沙崩损药栏，也从江槛落风湍。新松恨不高千尺，恶竹应须斩万竿。生理祗凭黄阁老，衰颜欲付紫金丹。三年奔走空皮骨，信有人间行路难。锦官城西生事微，乌皮几在还思归。昔去为忧乱兵入，今来已恐邻人非。侧身天地更怀古，回首风尘甘息机。共说总戎云鸟阵，不妨游子芰荷衣。,Reality,Du Fu,"On the way to Chengdu Thatched Cottage, You Zuo first sent Yan Zhenggong five poems","have to go back to the hut and go to Chengdu, and I will cut the talisman again for Wen Weng. But the envoy Lu Yan returned his bow, and dared to talk about the long-term barrenness of Songzhu. Yu knows the origin of C acupoint is beautiful, and wine recalls that Pitong does not need to drink. Wu Majiu once knew the trails, and wrote letters to potential husbands several times. There are white apples everywhere in the Qingjiang River, and the remnant spring can still be seen in the hometown. There are no soldiers and horses for scouts in the snow mountain, but there are masters for caterers in Jinli. Don't blame children for being vulgar, not teaching geese and ducks to be angry with neighbors. Xichi has not felt that the wind is exhausted, and the situation is renewed in Jingzhou. The bamboo is cold, the sand is green, and the flower stream is green, and the thorns and rattan tips are close at hand. Passers-by have to worry about going in and out, and residents can't understand things by themselves. The bookmark medicine wraps the spider web, and the wild shop mountain bridge sends the horseshoe. How can I take advantage of the spring grass in the deserted court to be sentenced to be drunk first. Often the bitter sand collapses and damages the medicine bar, and it also falls from the river sill in turbulent wind. The new pine hates that it is not a thousand feet high, and the evil bamboo should be cut off by thousands of poles. Physiology only depends on Huang Ge's old age, and the aging face wants to pay for Zijin Dan. After three years of running around, I believe that it is difficult for some people to travel. There is little going on in the west of Jinguan City, and Wu Pi is still thinking about returning. In the past, it was for fear of chaos and soldiers entering, but now it is fear of neighbors and others. Turning sideways to the world is more nostalgic, looking back at the wind and dust. Let's talk about the general Rong Yunniao formation, so you might as well wander around and wear Heyi."
现实,杜甫,黄河二首,唐,黄河北岸海西军，椎鼓鸣钟天下闻。铁马长鸣不知数，胡人高鼻动成群。黄河西岸是吾蜀，欲须供给家无粟。愿驱众庶戴君王，混一车书弃金玉。,Reality,Du Fu,Two Poems of the Yellow River,"On the north bank of the Yellow River, the Haixi Army, the sound of the vertebral drum and the bell are heard all over the world. The iron horses roared endlessly, and the barbarians gathered in groups with high noses. On the west bank of the Yellow River is my Shu, and I have no millet to feed my family. I would like to drive all the common people to wear the king, and abandon gold and jade with a cart of books."
现实,杜甫,送舍弟频赴齐州三首,唐,岷岭南蛮北，徐关东海西。此行何日到，送汝万行啼。绝域惟高枕，清风独杖藜。危时暂相见，衰白意都迷。风尘暗不开，汝去几时来。兄弟分离苦，形容老病催。江通一柱观，日落望乡台。客意长东北，齐州安在哉。诸姑今海畔，两弟亦山东。去傍干戈觅，来看道路通。短衣防战地，匹马逐秋风。莫作俱流落，长瞻碣石鸿。,Reality,Du Fu,Send my younger brother to Qizhou three times,"Minling is in the south and barbarians are in the north, Xuguan is in the east and the sea is in the west. When will this trip come, and I will send you Wanxing to cry. The absolute domain is only a high pillow, and the breeze is alone. See you for a while in a critical time, and you will be lost in the decline and whiteness. The wind and dust are dark, when will you come. The separation of brothers is bitter, and it is described as old and sick. Jiangtong is a one-pillar view, and the sunset looks at the hometown. The guest's intention grows in the northeast, and Qizhou is safe. The aunts are now by the sea, and the two younger brothers are also in Shandong. Go to fight to find the way to see the road. Short clothes against the battlefield, horses chasing the autumn wind. Don't make all the exiles, and look forward to Jieshihong."
现实,杜甫,夔州歌十绝句,唐,中巴之东巴东山，江水开辟流其间。白帝高为三峡镇，夔州险过百牢关。白帝夔州各异城，蜀江楚峡混殊名。英雄割据非天意，霸主并吞在物情。群雄竞起问前朝，王者无外见今朝。比讶渔阳结怨恨，元听舜日旧箫韶。赤甲白盐俱刺天，闾阎缭绕接山巅。枫林橘树丹青合，复道重楼锦绣悬。瀼东瀼西一万家，江北江南春冬花。背飞鹤子遗琼蕊，相趁凫雏入蒋牙。东屯稻畦一百顷，北有涧水通青苗。晴浴狎鸥分处处，雨随神女下朝朝。蜀麻吴盐自古通，万斛之舟行若风。长年三老长歌里，白昼摊钱高浪中。忆昔咸阳都市合，山水之图张卖时。巫峡曾经宝屏见，楚宫犹对碧峰疑。武侯祠堂不可忘，中有松柏参天长。干戈满地客愁破，云日如火炎天凉。阆风玄圃与蓬壶，中有高堂天下无。借问夔州压何处，峡门江腹拥城隅。,Reality,Du Fu,Ten Quatrains of Kuizhou Song,"In the Dongba Dongshan of China and Pakistan, the river is opened up and flows in it. Baidi Gao was the town of Three Gorges, and Kuizhou narrowly passed Bailao Pass. There are different cities in Baidi Kuizhou, and the Shu River and Chu Gorge are mixed with different names. It is not God's will for heroes to divide their rule, and the overlord annexes things. The heroes compete to ask about the previous dynasty, but the king can see the current dynasty without outsiders. Surprised by Yuyang's resentment, Yuan listened to Shun's old Xiaoshao. Both red armor and white salt pierced the sky, and Lu Yan lingered around the top of the mountain. The maple forest and orange trees are green and green, and the complex roads and double buildings are beautifully hung. There are ten thousand houses in the east and west, spring and winter flowers in the north and south of the Yangtze River. Carrying the flying crane and leaving Qiongrui, they took advantage of the ducklings to enter Jiangya. There are 100 hectares of rice fields in Dongtun, and there are Jianshui Tongqingmiao in the north. Sunny baths and Apgulls are everywhere, and rain follows the goddess. Shu Ma Wu salt has been known since ancient times, and the boat of thousands of Dendrobium travels like the wind. In the long songs of the three elders for many years, the money is shared in the high waves during the day. Recalling that Xianyang was a city in the past, when pictures of landscapes were sold. Wuxia once saw Baoping, but the Chu Palace was still suspicious of Bifeng. The ancestral hall of Marquis Wu cannot be forgotten, and there are towering pines and cypresses in it. Fighting is full of sorrows, and the sky is like fire and the sky is cool. Langfeng Xuanpu and Penghu, there is a high hall in it, and there is nothing in the world. May I ask where Kuizhou is located? The Xiamen River surrounds the city."
现实,杜甫,解闷十二首,唐,草阁柴扉星散居，浪翻江黑雨飞初。山禽引子哺红果，溪友得钱留白鱼。商胡离别下扬州，忆上西陵故驿楼。为问淮南米贵贱，老夫乘兴欲东流。一辞故国十经秋，每见秋瓜忆故丘。今日南湖采薇蕨，何人为觅郑瓜州。沈范早知何水部，曹刘不待薛郎中。独当省署开文苑，兼泛沧浪学钓翁。李陵苏武是吾师，孟子论文更不疑。一饭未曾留俗客，数篇今见古人诗。复忆襄阳孟浩然，清诗句句尽堪传。即今耆旧无新语，漫钓槎头缩颈鳊。陶冶性灵在底物，新诗改罢自长吟。孰知二谢将能事，颇学阴何苦用心。不见高人王右丞，蓝田丘壑漫寒藤。最传秀句寰区满，未绝风流相国能。先帝贵妃今寂寞，荔枝还复入长安。炎方每续朱樱献，玉座应悲白露团。忆过泸戎摘荔枝，青峰隐映石逶迤。京中旧见无颜色，红颗酸甜只自知。翠瓜碧李沈玉甃，赤梨葡萄寒露成。可怜先不异枝蔓，此物娟娟长远生。侧生野岸及江蒲，不熟丹宫满玉壶。云壑布衣骀背死，劳生重马翠眉须。,Reality,Du Fu,Twelve Poems to Relieve Boredom,"The Caoge Chaifei stars live scattered, the waves turn over the river and the black rain flies to the beginning. The introduction of mountain birds feeds red fruits, and the friends of the stream get money to keep white fish. Shang Hu left Yangzhou, recalled the old posthouse in Xiling. In order to ask Huainan rice is high or low, the old man took advantage of his interest and wanted to go eastward. A word about the old country, ten classics and autumn, every time I see autumn melons, I recall the old hill. Today Nanhu is picking weed and fern, who is looking for Zheng Guazhou? Shen Fan knew He Shuibu early on, and Cao Liu didn't wait for Xue Langzhong. He is the only provincial office to open Wenyuan, and he is also a fisherman who learns from Canglang. Li Ling and Su Wu are my teachers, and I have no doubts about Mencius's thesis. There are no vulgar guests for a meal, and several ancient poems can be seen today. Recalling Meng Haoran in Xiangyang, every line of Qing poetry can be passed down. That is to say, today's old people have nothing new to say, and they are constantly fishing for bream with neck neck. Cultivate the soul in the substrate, and change the new poems from Changyin. Who knows that Er Xie will be able to do things, so why bother to work hard. Wang Youcheng, an expert, is not seen, and the blue fields and hills are full of cold vines. It is most said that the Xiuju Huan area is full, and the romantic Xiangguoneng has never ceased. The noble concubine of the first emperor is lonely now, and the lychee has returned to Chang'an. Every time Yanfang continued Zhuying's offering, Yuzuo should mourn Bailutuan. Recalling that Lu Rong picked lychees, and the green peaks reflected the winding stones. The old sight in Beijing has no color, but the sweet and sour red ones only know themselves. Green melons, green plums, deep jade, red pears, grapes and cold dew. It's a pity that there are no different branches and vines, this thing is beautiful and long-lived. Wild banks and river cattails grow on the side, and jade pots are full of unfamiliar Dan Gong. The commoner in Yunhe died with his back on his back, and he gave birth to Ma Cui's eyebrows."
现实,杜甫,遣兴五首,唐,天用莫如龙，有时系扶桑。顿辔海徒涌，神人身更长。性命苟不存，英雄徒自强。吞声勿复道，真宰意茫茫。地用莫如马，无良复谁记。此日千里鸣，追风可君意。君看渥洼种，态与驽骀异。不杂蹄齧间，逍遥有能事。我今日夜忧，诸弟各异方。不知死与生，何况道路长。避寇一分散，饥寒永相望。岂无柴门归，欲出畏虎狼。仰看云中雁，禽鸟亦有行。蓬生非无根，漂荡随高风。天寒落万里，不复归本丛。客子念故宅，三年门巷空。怅望但烽火，戎车满关东。生涯能几何，常在羁旅中。昔在洛阳时，亲友相追攀。送客东郊道，遨游宿南山。烟尘阻长河，树羽成皋间。回首载酒地，岂无一日还。丈夫贵壮健，惨戚非朱颜。,Reality,Du Fu,Send Xing five poems,"Heaven uses nothing like a dragon, and sometimes it is a hibiscus. When the bridle is stopped, the sea is full, and the body of the god is longer. If life does not survive, heroes only strive for self-improvement. Don't repeat your words if you swallow your voice, the real killer is boundless. The use of land is like a horse, who will remember the unscrupulous. This day, thousands of miles of singing, chasing the wind can be the king's will. Look at the Owa species, the attitude is different from that of the scorpion. No miscellaneous hoof gnawing, happy and capable. I am worried today and night, and all my brothers are in different directions. I don't know death and life, not to mention the long road. Once the evaders are scattered, we will always look at each other in hunger and cold. How can there be no firewood to return to, and want to go out to fear tigers and wolves. Looking up at the geese in the clouds, the birds can do it too. Pengsheng is not rootless, drifting with the high wind. The weather is cold and falling thousands of miles, and it will no longer return to the cluster. Hakka's former residence was empty for three years. Disappointed but the flames of war, military chariots are full of Kanto. How much can life be, often in prison. When I was in Luoyang in the past, relatives and friends chased after each other. See off guests on Dongjiao Road, travel to Nanshan. The smoke and dust block the long river, and the feathers of the trees form a space. Looking back at the place where the wine was loaded, there will be no day to return it. A husband is expensive and healthy, but a miserable wife is not a beauty."
现实,杜甫,前出塞九首,唐,戚戚去故里，悠悠赴交河。公家有程期，亡命婴祸罗。君已富土境，开边一何多。弃绝父母恩，吞声行负戈。出门日已远，不受徒旅欺。骨肉恩岂断，男儿死无时。走马脱辔头，手中挑青丝。捷下万仞冈，俯身试搴旗。磨刀呜咽水，水赤刃伤手。欲轻肠断声，心绪乱已久。丈夫誓许国，愤惋复何有。功名图骐驎，战骨当速朽。送徒既有长，远戍亦有身。生死向前去，不劳吏怒嗔。路逢相识人，附书与六亲。哀哉两决绝，不复同苦辛。迢迢万馀里，领我赴三军。军中异苦乐，主将宁尽闻。隔河见胡骑，倏忽数百群。我始为奴仆，几时树功勋。挽弓当挽强，用箭当用长。射人先射马，擒贼先擒王。杀人亦有限，列国自有疆。苟能制侵陵，岂在多杀伤。驱马天雨雪，军行入高山。径危抱寒石，指落曾冰间。已去汉月远，何时筑城还。浮云暮南征，可望不可攀。单于寇我垒，百里风尘昏。雄剑四五动，彼军为我奔。虏其名王归，系颈授辕门。潜身备行列，一胜何足论。从军十年馀，能无分寸功。众人贵苟得，欲语羞雷同。中原有斗争，况在狄与戎。丈夫四方志，安可辞固穷。,Reality,Du Fu,Nine Poems,"Qi Qi went to his hometown and went to Jiaohe leisurely. The public has a certain period of time, and the dead baby is woluo. You are already rich in the land, how much is there to open. Abandoning the kindness of parents, swallowing one's voice and carrying one's sword. The day of going out is far away, so I won't be bullied by pilgrims. How can the kindness of flesh and blood be broken? There is no time for a man to die. The horse took off the bridle and picked the black silk in his hand. Jiexia Wanrengang, leaning over to try to hold the flag. Grinding the knife whimpers water, and the water red blade hurts the hand. I want to lightly break my heart, and my mind has been in chaos for a long time. The husband vowed to promise the country, but he was angry and regretful. Fame and fame, the bones of battle should decay quickly. Sending off apprentices has both strengths and long-distance garrison. Life and death go forward, without labor and anger. Meet acquaintances on the road, attach a book and six relatives. Alas, the two decisions are no longer the same. For more than ten thousand miles, lead me to the three armies. The army is full of bitterness and joy, and the general Ning can hear it all. Seeing Hu Qi across the river, hundreds of them suddenly. I started out as a slave, when will I make meritorious deeds. When drawing a bow, it should be strong, and when using an arrow, it should be long. When shooting a man, shoot a horse first, and when capturing a thief, first capture the king. Killing is also limited, and countries have their own borders. If you can control the invasion of the mausoleum, how can you kill more. Driving horses in rain and snow, the army marched into the mountains. The path is dangerous, holding the cold stone, and pointing to the falling Zeng Bingjian. I have gone to Han Yueyuan, when will I build the city and return it. Floating clouds and twilight south marches, hopeful and unattainable. Shan Yu Kou and I base, a hundred miles away from the wind and dust. The male sword moved four or five times, and the other army ran for me. He was captured and named Wanggui, tied around his neck and conferred on Yuanmen. Ambush to prepare for the ranks, one victory is nothing. He has been in the army for more than ten years, and he can do his best without any measure. Everyone is too expensive to get it, and they are ashamed to say something. The struggle in the Central Plains is between Di and Rong. Husband Quartet Chronicles, Anke Ci solid poverty."
现实,杜甫,后出塞五首,唐,男儿生世间，及壮当封侯。战伐有功业，焉能守旧丘。召募赴蓟门，军动不可留。千金买马鞭，百金装刀头。闾里送我行，亲戚拥道周。斑白居上列，酒酣进庶羞。少年别有赠，含笑看吴钩。朝进东门营，暮上河阳桥。落日照大旗，马鸣风萧萧。平沙列万幕，部伍各见招。中天悬明月，令严夜寂寥。悲笳数声动，壮士惨不骄。借问大将谁，恐是霍嫖姚。古人重守边，今人重高勋。岂知英雄主，出师亘长云。六合已一家，四夷且孤军。遂使貔虎士，奋身勇所闻。拔剑击大荒，日收胡马群。誓开玄冥北，持以奉吾君。献凯日继踵，两蕃静无虞。渔阳豪侠地，击鼓吹笙竽。云帆转辽海，粳稻来东吴。越罗与楚练，照耀舆台躯。主将位益崇，气骄凌上都。边人不敢议，议者死路衢。我本良家子，出师亦多门。将骄益愁思，身贵不足论。跃马二十年，恐辜明主恩。坐见幽州骑，长驱河洛昏。中夜间道归，故里但空村。恶名幸脱免，穷老无儿孙。,Reality,Du Fu,five poems,"When a man is born in the world, he will be a marquis when he is strong. How can you defend the old hills if you have meritorious deeds in war. Called to Jimen, the army must not stay. Thousands of gold buy a horsewhip, and hundreds of gold buy a knife head. Luli saw me off, and relatives embraced Zhou. Spotted and white ranks on the top list, and the wine is drunk and the public is ashamed. The young man has something special to offer, and he looks at Wu Gou with a smile. Enter the Dongmen Camp in the morning, and go to the Heyang Bridge in the evening. The setting sun illuminated the banner, and Ma Mingfeng was in a bad mood. There are tens of thousands of screens in Pingsha, and all the troops see their moves. A bright moon hangs in the middle of the sky, making Yan Ye lonely. The sound of grief is loud, and the strong man is miserable. If I ask who the general is, I'm afraid it's Huo whoring Yao. The ancients valued guarding the border, but today's people value high honors. Unexpectedly, the hero master, the teacher goes through the clouds. Liuhe is already a family, and Siyi is alone. So he made the Pihu warriors bravely hear what he heard. Draw your sword and strike the wilderness, and harvest the horses every day. I swear to open Xuanmingbei, and hold it to serve my lord. The day of Xiankai followed, and the two tribes were quiet and safe. Yuyang is heroic, playing drums and shengyu. Yunfan turns to Liaohai, japonica rice comes to Soochow. Yue Luo and Chu Lian shine on Yutai. The chief general is highly respected, and his arrogance dominates Shangdu. People on the side dare not discuss it, and those who discuss it will die. I am originally a son of a good family, and I have many teachers. If you will be proud and sad, you will not be worth it. Leaping the horse for twenty years, I am afraid of honoring the grace of the Lord Ming. Sit and see Youzhou ride, and drive Heluo faint. In the middle of the night, I return home, but my hometown is empty. Fortunately, the notoriety was spared, and he was poor and old without children and grandchildren."
现实,杜甫,前苦寒行二首,唐,汉时长安雪一丈，牛马毛寒缩如猬。楚江巫峡冰入怀，虎豹哀号又堪记。秦城老翁荆扬客，惯习炎蒸岁絺绤。玄冥祝融气或交，手持白羽未敢释。去年白帝雪在山，今年白帝雪在地。冻埋蛟龙南浦缩，寒刮肌肤北风利。楚人四时皆麻衣，楚天万里无晶辉。三足之乌足恐断，羲和送将何所归。,Reality,Du Fu,Two Poems Before the Bitter Cold,"In the Han Dynasty, the snow in Chang'an was a foot long, and the hair of cattle and horses shrank like a hedgehog. The Wu Gorge on the Chu River is frozen into the bosom, and the wailing of tigers and leopards is unforgettable. Jing Yangke, an old man in Qincheng, is used to steaming and steaming rice. Xuan Ming wished Rong Qi might be handed over, but he didn't dare to release the white feather in his hand. Last year Baidi snowed on the mountain, this year Baidi snowed on the ground. Frozen buried Jiaolong shrinks in Nanpu, the cold blows the skin and the north wind is sharp. The people of Chu wear sackcloth all the time, and there is no crystal brilliance in the sky of Chu. The three-legged black foot is afraid of breaking off, where will Xihe send him off?"
现实,杜甫,少年行二首,唐,莫笑田家老瓦盆，自从盛酒长儿孙。倾银注瓦惊人眼，共醉终同卧竹根。巢燕养雏浑去尽，江花结子已无多。黄衫年少来宜数，不见堂前东逝波。,Reality,Du Fu,Two Poems for Teenagers,"Mo Xiaotian's old crockpot has grown up with children and grandchildren since it was filled with wine. Pour silver into the tiles to startle the eyes, get drunk and end up lying on the same bamboo root. Nest swallows have exhausted their chicks, and there are not many flowers in the river. It's better to count the yellow shirts when they are young, and they don't see the waves passing away in front of the hall."
