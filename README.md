Interpreting Poems from Tang Dynasty


Tang Poetry is a literary tradition that emerged during China's Tang dynasty and is characterized by its distinctive style and rich poetic tradition. Considered the Golden Age of Chinese poetry, the Tang dynasty produced over 48,900 poems written by more than 2,200 authors, which were compiled into the Quan Tangshi. During this period, poetry played a vital role in social life, with scholars required to master the art for civil service exams. However, poetry was not limited to the elite and was accessible to everyone, resulting in a vast record of poetry and poets that survives today. Li Bai and Du Fu, two of the most famous poets of the era, continue to be celebrated for their contributions to the Tang Poetry canon.


To honor this rich literary tradition, a web application has been developed that allows users to read through a curated collection of Tang Poetry in the form of interactive poem cards. The application also allows users to select and convert their favorite poems into Chinese paintings using Dall-E, an AI image generation tool. Finally, the application invites users to draw their own paintings, providing a creative outlet for exploring and interpreting the poetry. Through this application, users can engage with and appreciate the beauty of Tang Poetry in new and innovative ways, bridging the gap between traditional and modern art forms. The project serves as a testament to the enduring legacy of Tang Poetry and its ability to inspire creativity and imagination.
